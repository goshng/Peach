Multiple facets of bacterial transcriptome can be tackled using a
high-throughput sequencing technology called RNA-Seq.  Of the uses of RNA-Seq
ascertaining differentially expressed genes among different biological
conditions has been a focus. To put millions of short reads of mRNAs from
RNA-Seq in the context of differential expression study one needs preprocess the
huge data (Oshlack et al., 2010). We describe this procedure in a nutshell by
focusing on bacterial transcriptome study.  A reference genome with annotated
genes is required unless a de novo assembly is employed. Annotated genes include
any genomic regions along the reference genome. They are not limited to protein
coding genes, but a prior knowledge about any genomic regions can be used to
list regions of biological interest.  Each of the predefined genomic regions are
examined to count short reads that are mapped to the reference genome using a
short read alinger such as BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009), a Burrows wheeler
transform algorithm.  After these mapping of short reads to a reference genome
and summarization of the mapped reads based on predefined genomic regions as a
table of counts, a statistical hypothesis testing for finding differentially
expressed genes can be performed on the table with a R-package such as DEseq
(Anders and Huber, 2010) or edgeR (Robinson et al., 2010).  This prodecure would
produce a list of differentially expressed genes.  Further analyses such as
functionaly category enrichment test (Young et al., 2010) can be pursued.

Using the summary of gene-wise
expression of two biological conditions we ascertain differentially expressed
genes.  A statistical hypothesis testing on the gene-wise counts is employed.

The testing is based on statistical models including a Poisson model of read
counts (Marioni et al. 2008), and a negative binomial model to account for
variation in replicates (Robinson and Smith, 2007).

Because RNA-Seq is highly reproducible, technical replicates are often
unnecessary. However, biological replicates would allow to account for
biological variation.

We adjust for different total read counts from samples by normalizing RNA-Seq
data (e.g., Robinson and Oshlack, 2010).
Because genes with low read counts can lead to biases, 
we remove genes with low counts, or below a threshold of counts.
Transcript length (Oshlack and Wakefield, 2010; Young et al., 2010) should be
considered to remove biases; simple division
of read counts by gene lengths does not remove this potential bias.

differentially expressed genes under two biological conditions.
