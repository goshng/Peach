Genetic Diversity and Population Size: Genomic Insights into an Old Riddle
==========================================================================

Jeffrey L. Peters

Genetic Diversity within Population

Heterozygosity vs. log Ne

Leffler et al (2012) PLoS Biology

Range of genetic diversity and range of population size?

Matthew Hahn (2008) Evolution

Neutral expectations of "Old Riddle"?

Ducks from the genus Anas

Genetic diversity/Population size in 41 species of ducks

RADseq 3,300 loci

log pi - N : an increasing line

log pi - log N : ------- horizontal line

Northern pintail - Anas acuta

the Last Glacial Maximum ~21,000 ybp

Brown pintail - Anas georgica

Species distribution model - Genetic data

log Theta vs. log N (census size) - an increasing line

Expected changed in ...? what is it?

the last interglacial (~110,000 ybp)

mallards and mottled ducks ( 5 nuclear introns )
Census <= Genetic Diversity ?

Gray teal vs. Chestnut : weak migration

Census size - 27 grey:1 chestnut
Autosomal - 2.4
Z-linked - 29

Bamshad and Wooding 2003. NRG 4:99-111

Coefficient of variation : sd/mean - data vs. simulation under neutral ->
selection?

Fixed differences/Shared polymorphisms

Fixed differences - Mean proportion of sites vs. nucleotide diversity (negative
correlation)
Shared polymorphisms - (positive correlation)

log pi vs. log N - balancing, neutral, selection in decreasing order of slopes

Q&A:

Any general conclusion in terms of biogeographic scale?
