Freshwater population of stickleback was known to be derived from Seawater
population. Selective sweep happens in a region of freshwater population
indicated by low pi and large Fst.

----------
Higher Fst compared with background Fst could indicate selection. Plots of Fst
were used to search for potentially selected genomic regions. Genetic inversion
could cause rapid evolutoin. 

Ecology of organisms due to glacier movements.

Moderate.
Good intro.
