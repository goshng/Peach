==================

elevation vs. avian diversity
the Andes - wetlands
tropical high-altitude Andean wetlands - waterbirds
environmental disturbance in the Andes
air density and oxygen pressure decline
hypoxia resistence
acclimatization response - 45 days for 4000 meters 
adaptations in egg shells - middle and high altitude eggs
Bar-headed Goose (Anser indicus)
Jessen et al. (1991), Weber et al. (1993), and Andean goose - Ala Pro ...
A theory ... 
  8 species of Andean ducks
  sampling since 2001 ... GBS (RAD-seq)
  McCracken et al. (2009) Mol Ecol 18:3992-4005
  Ser (high-altitude derived) Asn (low-altitude ancestral)
non-adaptive and adaptive plasticity
  Torrent ducks
  Hb concentration
  recent divergence - high Hb concentration difference
  ancient divergence - little Hb concentration difference
  Merganetta armata ... subspecies
Ancestral alleles (Ala/Ala) are beneficial over descendent alleles (Pro/Pro).
