Three principles
Selected genes and pathways
Hormone signaling

Gene expression levels are different among social status of bees: nursing,
foraging, and aggression.

Scouting
Scouts have personality.   

Social regulation
African honey bees vs. European honey bees

Metabolism enes also under selection during evolution of eusociality in bees.

carbohydrate catabolism
phosphorylation

Meta-analysis tools reveal common transcrtiptional regulatory basis.

Modular mosaic regulation.

Future works
1. Exprimental validation of systems biology predictions.
2. Molecular pathways vs. neural cicuits
3. Different evolutions, similar mechanisms: Genetic toolkits for social behaviors?
