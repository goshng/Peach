Title. A field guide to genealogy samplers

.Three ways of getting unknown ancestral relationships
. A correct relationship.
. Sum over all possible relationships.
. Compromise by summing over plausible relationships.

.Genealogy sampler
. Variability among trees for error bars

.Sampler-based studies

.Survey of genealogy sampler software
. BEAST: relaxed-clock, skyline plot, starbeast
. IM: useful for populations less than 4N generations old
. LAMARC: models with recombination, SNP data
. MIGRATE-N: skylineplot
. GENETREE: specific mutation event  

.Right data for a right research
. Ancient DNA
. Long sequence
. Recently diverged pop'n
. High or low polymorphism

.What happen if I ignore
. recombination:
. growth:
. recent population divergence:
. natural selection:

.Data requirement for sampler
. random
. appropriate mutation models
. polymorphic
. neutral or under purifying selection

.What happen if I ignore
. recombination:

. recent population divergence:
. natural selection:

.Data requirement for sampler
. random
. appropriate mutation models
. polymorphic
. neutral or under purifying selection

.How can we detect these problems?
. error bars
. behavior of program from run to run
. visualize trees

.case study I
. K. McCracken
 
.case study II
. Brian Reid

.case study III
. Peter Bereli
. mtDNA
. Need nucleic loci, ancient sample, more sample

Review paper for using these.
