  abstract = {The SWISS-PROT protein knowledgebase (http://www.expasy.org/sprot/

	with the current knowledge in the Life Sciences. Each protein entry
	provides an interdisciplinary overview of relevant information by
	bringing together experimental results, computed features and sometimes
	even contradictory conclusions. Detailed expertise that goes beyond
	the scope of SWISS-PROT is made available via direct links to specialised
	databases. SWISS-PROT provides annotated entries for all species,
	but concentrates on the annotation of entries from human (the HPI
	project) and other model organisms to ensure the presence of high
	quality annotation for representative members of all protein families.
	Part of the annotation can be transferred to other family members,
	as is already done for microbes by the High-quality Automated and
	Manual Annotation of microbial Proteomes (HAMAP) project. Protein
	families and groups of proteins are regularly reviewed to keep up
	with current scientific findings. Complementarily, TrEMBL strives
	to comprise all protein sequences that are not yet represented in
	SWISS-PROT, by incorporating a perpetually increasing level of mostly
	automated annotation. Researchers are welcome to contribute their
	knowledge to the scientific community by submitting relevant findings
	to SWISS-PROT at swiss-prot@expasy.org.},

  abstract = {In cases where the structure of a single protein is represented by
	an ensemble of conformations, there is often a need to determine
	the common features and to choose a "representative" conformation.
	This occurs, for example, with structures determined by NMR spectroscopy,
	analysis of the trajectory from a molecular dynamics simulation,
	or an ensemble of structures produced by comparative modeling. We
	reported previously automatic methods for (1) defining the atoms
	with low spatial variance across an ensemble (i.e., the "core" atoms)
	and the domains in which these atoms lie, and (2) clustering an ensemble
	into conformationally related subfamilies. To extend the utility
	of these methods, we have developed a freely available server on
	the World Wide Web at http:/(/)neon.chem.le.ac.uk/olderado/. This
	(1) contains an automatically generated database of representative
	structures, core atoms, and domains determined for 449 ensembles
	of NMR-derived protein structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
	in May 1997, and (2) allows the user to upload a PDB-formatted file
	containing the coordinates of an ensemble of structures. The server
	returns in real time: (1) information on the residues constituting
	domains: (2) the structures that constitute each conformational subfamily;
	and (3) an interactive java-based three-dimensional viewer to visualise
	the domains and clusters. Such information is useful, for example,
	when selecting conformations to be used in comparative modeling and
	when choosing parts of structures to be used in molecular replacement.
	Here we describe the OLDERADO server.},

  abstract = {Motivation: UniProtKB/SwissProt is the main resource for detailed
	annotations of protein sequences. This database provides a jumping-off
	point to many other resources through the links it provides. Among
	others, these include other primary databases, secondary databases,
	the Gene Ontology and OMIM. While a large number of links are provided
	to Protein Data Bank (PDB) files, obtaining a regularly updated mapping
	between UniProtKB entries and PDB entries at the chain or residue
	level is not straightforward. In particular, there is no regularly
	updated resource which allows a UniProtKB/SwissProt entry to be identified
	for a given residue of a PDB file. Results: We have created a completely
	automatically maintained database which maps PDB residues to residues
	in UniProtKB/SwissProt and UniProtKB/trEMBL entries. The protocol
	uses links from PDB to UniProtKB, from UniProtKB to PDB and a brute-force
	sequence scan to resolve PDB chains for which no annotated link is
	available. Finally the sequences from PDB and UniProtKB are aligned
	to obtain a residue-level mapping. Availability: The resource may
	be queried interactively or downloaded from http://www.bioinf.org.uk/pdbsws/

  abstract = {Simplifying assumptions are necessary to model complex biological
	processes. Although some assumptions may make sense mathematically,
	they are often implausible when literally translated. This is especially
	true of the independence among codons assumption, which states that
	the evolutionary rate at one codon isindependent of the evolutionary
	rate at surrounding codons. Sites within proteinsmust interact in
	order to form intricate three-dimensional binding sites and activation
	domains. This dissertation details the derivation of a procedure
	for statistical inference when independent change is not assumed.
	The procedure is implemented in a Bayesian framework where Markov
	chain Monte Carlo methods permit approximation of posterior distributions.
	Analyses with the procedure on data sets with two and three taxa
	are explored and biologically plausible values of the solvent accessibility
	and pairwise interaction parameters are inferred. Via these analyses,
	we illustrate the chronological ordering of amino acid replacements
	and the detection of specific events to be positively selected. We
	also find spatial clustering of the amino acid replacements that
	have most affected sequence-structure compatibility during the evolution
	of primate eosinophil-derived neurotoxin proteins.},

  abstract = {Widely used models of protein evolution ignore protein structure.
	Therefore, these models do not predict spatial clustering of amino
	acid replacements with respect to tertiary structure. One formal
	and biologically implausible possibility is that there is no tendency
	for amino acid replacements to be spatially clustered during evolution.
	An alternative to this is that amino acid replacements are spatially
	clustered and this spatial clustering can be fully explained by a
	tendency for similar rates of amino acid replacement at sites that
	are nearby in protein tertiary structure. A third possibility is
	that the amount of clustering exceeds that which can be explained
	solely on the basis of independently evolving protein sites with
	spatially clustered replacement rates. We introduce two simple and
	not very parametric hypothesis tests that help distinguish these
	three possibilities. We then apply these tests to 273 homologous
	protein families. The null hypothesis of no spatial clustering is
	rejected for 102 of 273 families. The explanation of spatially clustered
	rates but independent change among sites is rejected for 43 families.
	These findings need to be reconciled with the common practice of
	basing evolutionary inferences on models that assume independent
	change among sites.},
