  abstract = {Advances in sequencing technology provide special opportunities for
	genotyping individuals with speed and thrift, but the lack of software
	to automate the calling of tens of thousands of genotypes over hundreds
	of individuals has hindered progress. Stacks is a software system
	that uses short-read sequence data to identify and genotype loci
	in a set of individuals either de novo or by comparison to a reference
	genome. From reduced representation Illumina sequence data, such
	as RAD-tags, Stacks can recover thousands of single nucleotide polymorphism
	(SNP) markers useful for the genetic analysis of crosses or populations.
	Stacks can generate markers for ultra-dense genetic linkage maps,
	facilitate the examination of population phylogeography, and help
	in reference genome assembly. We report here the algorithms implemented
	in Stacks and demonstrate their efficacy by constructing loci from
	simulated RAD-tags taken from the stickleback reference genome and
	by recapitulating and improving a genetic map of the zebrafish, Danio
	rerio.},

	KEY CONCEPTS AND METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS.},

  abstract = {Natural selection shapes patterns of genetic variation among individuals,
	populations, and species, and it does so differentially across genomes.
	The field of population genomics provides a comprehensive genome-scale
	view of the action of selection, even beyond traditional model organisms.
	However, even with nearly complete genomic sequence information,
	our ability to detect the signature of selection on specific genomic
	regions depends on choosing experimental and analytical tools appropriate
	to the biological situation. For example, processes that occur at
	different timescales, such as sorting of standing genetic variation,
	mutation-selection balance, or fixed interspecific divergence, have
	different consequences for genomic patterns of variation. Inappropriate
	experimental or analytical approaches may fail to detect even strong
	selection or falsely identify a signature of selection. Here we outline
	the conceptual framework of population genomics, relate genomic patterns
	of variation to evolutionary processes, and identify major biological
	factors to be considered in studies of selection. As data-gathering
	technology continues to advance, our ability to understand selection
	in natural populations will be limited more by conceptual and analytical
	weaknesses than by the amount of molecular data. Our aim is to bring
	critical biological considerations to the fore in population genomics
	research and to spur the development and application of analytical
	tools appropriate to diverse biological systems.},

  abstract = {Theory predicts that parallel evolution should be common when the
	number of beneficial mutations is limited by selective constraints
	on protein structure. However, confirmation is scarce in natural
	populations. Here we studied the major haemoglobin genes of eight
	Andean duck lineages and compared them to 115 other waterfowl species,
	including the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus) and Abyssinian blue-winged
	goose (Cyanochen cyanopterus), two additional species living at high
	altitude. One to five amino acid replacements were significantly
	overrepresented or derived in each highland population, and parallel
	substitutions were more common than in simulated sequences evolved
	under a neutral model. Two substitutions evolved in parallel in the
	alpha A subunit of two (Ala-alpha 8) and five (Thr-alpha 77) taxa,
	and five identical beta A subunit substitutions were observed in
	two (Ser-beta 4, Glu-beta 94, Met-beta 133) or three (Ser-beta 13,
	Ser-beta 116) taxa. Substitutions at adjacent sites within the same
	functional protein region were also observed. Five such replacements
	were in exterior, solvent-accessible positions on the A helix and
	AB corner of the alpha A subunit. Five others were in close proximity
	to inositolpentaphosphate binding sites, and two pairs of independent
	replacements occurred at two different alpha(1)beta(1) intersubunit
	contacts. More than half of the substitutions in highland lineages
	resulted in the acquisition of serine or threonine (18 gains vs.
	2 losses), both of which possess a hydroxyl group that can hydrogen
	bond to a variety of polar substrates. The patterns of parallel evolution
	observed in these waterfowl suggest that adaptation to high-altitude
	hypoxia has resulted from selection on unique but overlapping sets
	of one to five amino acid substitutions in each lineage.},
