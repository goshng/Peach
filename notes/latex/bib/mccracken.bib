  abstract = {Natural selection shapes patterns of genetic variation among individuals,
	populations, and species, and it does so differentially across genomes.
	The field of population genomics provides a comprehensive genome-scale
	view of the action of selection, even beyond traditional model organisms.
	However, even with nearly complete genomic sequence information,
	our ability to detect the signature of selection on specific genomic
	regions depends on choosing experimental and analytical tools appropriate
	to the biological situation. For example, processes that occur at
	different timescales, such as sorting of standing genetic variation,
	mutation-selection balance, or fixed interspecific divergence, have
	different consequences for genomic patterns of variation. Inappropriate
	experimental or analytical approaches may fail to detect even strong
	selection or falsely identify a signature of selection. Here we outline
	the conceptual framework of population genomics, relate genomic patterns
	of variation to evolutionary processes, and identify major biological
	factors to be considered in studies of selection. As data-gathering
	technology continues to advance, our ability to understand selection
	in natural populations will be limited more by conceptual and analytical
	weaknesses than by the amount of molecular data. Our aim is to bring
	critical biological considerations to the fore in population genomics
	research and to spur the development and application of analytical
	tools appropriate to diverse biological systems.},
