  abstract = {An algorithm for infering joint sibling relationships for a single
	generation sample of organisms based on DNA marker data is presented.
	The technique is based primarily on the exclusion principle, i.e.,
	the process of systematically eliminating hypothetical kinship types
	between individuals in the basis of DNA incompatibility. The result
	is an enumeration of all genetically compatible sibling groupings,
	which is maximal in the sense that no other individual can be added
	to the sibling group. The technique is computationally feasible for
	large samples given enough variability in the DNA markers used. From
	this, we construct a partition of the individuals into sibling groups
	based on a score. In addition, we derive some statistical properties
	of sibling compatibility events as well as various types of error
	probabilities associated with sibling identification. The techniques
	are illustrated using fisheries data.},

  title = {A Bayesian Analysis of Some Nonparametric Problems},
  journal = {The Annals of Statistics},
  year = {1973},
  volume = {1},
  pages = {209--230},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {The Bayesian approach to statistical problems, though fruitful in
	many ways, has been rather unsuccessful in treating nonparametric
	problems. This is due primarily to the difficulty in finding workable
	prior distributions on the parameter space, which in nonparametric
	ploblems is taken to be a set of probability distributions on a given
	sample space. There are two desirable properties of a prior distribution
	for nonparametric problems. (I) The support of the prior distribution
	should be large--with respect to some suitable topology on the space
	of probability distributions on the sample space. (II) Posterior
	distributions given a sample of observations from the true probability
	distribution should be manageable analytically. These properties
	are antagonistic in the sense that one may be obtained at the expense
	of the other. This paper presents a class of prior distributions,
	called Dirichlet process priors, broad in the sense of (I), for which
	(II) is realized, and for which treatment of many nonparametric statistical
	problems may be carried out, yielding results that are comparable
	to the classical theory. In Section 2, we review the properties of
	the Dirichlet distribution needed for the description of the Dirichlet
	process given in Section 3. Briefly, this process may be described
	as follows. Let \$\mathscr{X}\$ be a space and \$\mathscr{A}\$ a
	\$\sigma\$-field of subsets, and let \$\alpha\$ be a finite non-null
	measure on \$(\mathscr{X}, \mathscr{A})\$. Then a stochastic process
	\$P\$ indexed by elements \$A\$ of \$\mathscr{A}\$, is said to be
	a Dirichlet process on \$(\mathscr{X}, \mathscr{A})\$ with parameter
	\$\alpha\$ if for any measurable partition \$(A\_1, \cdots, A\_k)\$
	of \$\mathscr{X}\$, the random vector \$(P(A\_1), \cdots, P(A\_k))\$
	has a Dirichlet distribution with parameter \$(\alpha(A\_1), \cdots,
	\alpha(A\_k)). P\$ may be considered a random probability measure
	on \$(\mathscr{X}, \mathscr{A})\$, The main theorem states that if
	\$P\$ is a Dirichlet process on \$(\mathscr{X}, \mathscr{A})\$ with
	parameter \$\alpha\$, and if \$X\_1, \cdots, X\_n\$ is a sample from
	\$P\$, then the posterior distribution of \$P\$ given \$X\_1, \cdots,
	X\_n\$ is also a Dirichlet process on \$(\mathscr{X}, \mathscr{A})\$
	with a parameter \$\alpha + \sum^n\_1 \delta\_{x\_i}\$, where \$\delta\_x\$
	denotes the measure giving mass one to the point \$x\$. In Section
	4, an alternative definition of the Dirichlet process is given. This
	definition exhibits a version of the Dirichlet process that gives
	probability one to the set of discrete probability measures on \$(\mathscr{X},
	\mathscr{A})\$. This is in contrast to Dubins and Freedman [2], whose
	methods for choosing a distribution function on the interval [0,
	1] lead with probability one to singular continuous distributions.
	Methods of choosing a distribution function on [0, 1] that with probability
	one is absolutely continuous have been described by Kraft [7]. The
	general method of choosing a distribution function on [0, 1], described
	in Section 2 of Kraft and van Eeden [10], can of course be used to
	define the Dirichlet process on [0, 1]. Special mention must be made
	of the papers of Freedman and Fabius. Freedman [5] defines a notion
	of tailfree for a distribution on the set of all probability measures
	on a countable space \$\mathscr{X}\$. For a tailfree prior, posterior
	distribution given a sample from the true probability measure may
	be fairly easily computed. Fabius [3] extends the notion of tailfree
	to the case where \$\mathscr{X}\$ is the unit interval [0, 1], but
	it is clear his extension may be made to cover quite general \$\mathscr{X}\$.
	With such an extension, the Dirichlet process would be a special
	case of a tailfree distribution for which the posterior distribution
	has a particularly simple form. There are disadvantages to the fact
	that \$P\$ chosen by a Dirichlet process is discrete with probability
	one. These appear mainly because in sampling from a \$P\$ chosen
	by a Dirichlet process, we expect eventually to see one observation
	exactly equal to another. For example, consider the goodness-of-fit
	problem of testing the hypothesis \$H\_0\$ that a distribution on
	the interval [0, 1] is uniform. If on the alternative hypothesis
	we place a Dirichlet process prior with parameter \$\alpha\$ itself
	a uniform measure on [0, 1], and if we are given a sample of size
	\$n \geqq 2\$, the only nontrivial nonrandomized Bayes rule is to
	reject \$H\_0\$ if and only if two or more of the observations are
	exactly equal. This is really a test of the hypothesis that a distribution
	is continuous against the hypothesis that it is discrete. Thus, there
	is still a need for a prior that chooses a continuous distribution
	with probability one and yet satisfies properties (I) and (II). Some
	applications in which the possible doubling up of the values of the
	observations plays no essential role are presented in Section 5.
	These include the estimation of a distribution function, of a mean,
	of quantiles, of a variance and of a covariance. A two-sample problem
	is considered in which the Mann-Whitney statistic, equivalent to
	the rank-sum statistic, appears naturally. A decision theoretic upper
	tolerance limit for a quantile is also treated. Finally, a hypothesis
	testing problem concerning a quantile is shown to yield the sign
	test. In each of these problems, useful ways of combining prior information
	with the statistical observations appear. Other applications exist.
	In his Ph. D. dissertation [1], Charles Antoniak finds a need to
	consider mixtures of Dirichlet processes. He treats several problems,
	including the estimation of a mixing distribution, bio-assay, empirical
	Bayes problems, and discrimination problems.},

  abstract = {Inferring population structure from genetic data sampled from some
	number of individuals is a formidable statistical problem. One widely
	used approach considers the number of populations to be fixed and
	calculates the posterior probability of assigning individuals to
	each population. More recently, the assignment of individuals to
	populations and the number of populations have both been considered
	random variables that follow a Dirichlet process prior. We examined
	the statistical behavior of assignment of individuals to populations
	under a Dirichlet process prior. First, we examined a best-case scenario,
	in which all of the assumptions of the Dirichlet process prior were
	satisfied, by generating data under a Dirichlet process prior. Second,
	we examined the performance of the method when the genetic data were
	generated under a population genetics model with symmetric migration
	between populations. We examined the accuracy of population assignment
	using a distance on partitions. The method can be quite accurate
	with a moderate number of loci. As expected, inferences on the number
	of populations are more accurate when theta = 4N(e)u is large and
	when the migration rate (4N(e)m) is low. We also examined the sensitivity
	of inferences of population structure to choice of the parameter
	of the Dirichlet process model. Although inferences could be sensitive
	to the choice of the prior on the number of populations, this sensitivity
	occurred when the number of loci sampled was small; inferences are
	more robust to the prior on the number of populations when the number
	of sampled loci is large. Finally, we discuss several methods for
	summarizing the results of a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
	analysis of population structure. We develop the notion of the mean
	population partition, which is the partition of individuals to populations
	that minimizes the squared partition distance to the partitions sampled
	by the MCMC algorithm.},

	We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be
	unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies
	at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically)
	to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes
	indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular
	mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used
	genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications
	of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure,
	assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and
	identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method
	can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g.
	, seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from
	an endangered bird species. The software used for this article is
