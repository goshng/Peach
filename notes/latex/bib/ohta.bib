  abstract = {The model of very slightly deleterious mutations was examined from
	the standpoint of population genetics in relation to the molecular
	evolutionary clock. The distribution of selection coefficients of
	mutants (in terms of amino acid changes) with small effect is thought
	to be continuous around zero, with an average negative value. The
	variance of selection coefficients depends upon environmental diversity
	and hence on total population size of a species. By considering various
	examples of amino acid substitutions, the average and standard error
	of selection coefficients and the reciprocal of population size are
	assumed to have similar values. The model predicts negative correlation
	between evolutionary rate and population size. This effect is expected
	to be partially cancelled with the generation time effect of intrinsic
	mutation rate. Implications of this prediction on the molecular evolutionary
	clock are discussed.},

  abstract = {In order to clarify the nature of "near neutrality" in molecular evolution
	and polymorphism, extensive simulation studies were performed. Selection
	coefficients of new mutations are assumed to be small so that both
	random genetic drift and selection contribute to determining the
	behavior of mutants. The model also incorporates normally distributed
	spatial fluctuation of selection coefficients. If the system starts
	from "average neutrality," it will move to a better adapted state,
	and most new mutations will become "slightly deleterious." Monte
	Carlo simulations have indicated that such adaptation is attained,
	but that the rate of such "progress" is very low for weak selection.
	In general, the larger the population size, the more effective the
	selection becomes. Also, as selection becomes weaker, the behavior
	of the mutants approaches that of completely neutral genes. Thus,
	the weaker the selection, the smaller is the effect of population
	size on mutant dynamics. Increase of heterozygosity with population
	size is very pronounced for subdivided populations. The significance
	of these results is discussed in relation to various observed facts
	on molecular evolution and polymorphism, such as generation-time
	dependency and overdispersion of the molecular clock, or contrasting
	patterns of DNA and protein polymorphism among some closely related
	species.},
