  abstract = {High quality multiple alignments are crucial in the transfer of annotation
	from one genome to another. Multiple alignment methods strive to
	achieve ever increasing levels of average accuracy on benchmark sets
	while the accuracy of individual alignments is often overlooked.We
	have previously developed a method to automatically assess the accuracy
	and overall difficulty of multiple alignments. This was achieved
	by a per-residue comparison between alternate alignments of the same
	sequences. Here we present a key extension to this method, an algorithm
	to extract similarly aligned regions from several alignments and
	merge them into a new consensus alignment.We demonstrate that the
	fraction of correctly aligned residues within the resulting alignments
	is increased by 25-100 percent compared to the original input alignments,
	as only the most reliably aligned parts are considered.},
