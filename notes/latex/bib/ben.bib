	of the numbers of nucleotide substitutions along each branch do not

	transitional mutation rate of mtDNA, are higher in humans than in
	chimpanzees and gorillas probably by about two times. However, transversional
	mutation rate and amino acid substitution rate do not differ significantly

  abstract = {A large number of genes is shared by all living organisms, whereas
	many others are unique to some specific lineages, indicating their
	different times of origin. The availability of a growing number of
	eukaryotic genomes allows us to estimate which mammalian genes are
	novel genes and, approximately, when they arose. In this article,
	we classify human genes into four different age groups and estimate
	evolutionary rates in human and mouse orthologs. We show that older
	genes tend to evolve more slowly than newer ones; that is, proteins
	that arose earlier in evolution currently have a larger proportion
	of sites subjected to negative selection. Interestingly, this property
	is maintained when a fraction of the fastest-evolving genes is excluded
	or when only genes belonging to a given functional class are considered.
	One way to explain this relationship is by assuming that genes maintain
	their functional constraints along all their evolutionary history,
	but the nature of more recent evolutionary innovations is such that
	the functional constraints operating on them are increasingly weaker.
	Alternatively, our results would also be consistent with a scenario
	in which the functional constraints acting on a gene would not need
	to be constant through evolution. Instead, starting from weak functional
	constraints near the time of origin of a gene-as supported by mechanisms
	proposed for the origin of orphan genes-there would be a gradual
	increase in selective pressures with time, resulting in fewer accepted
	mutations in older versus more novel genes.},

	the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (omega = dN/dS), with omega
	< 1, omega = 1, and omega > 1 indicating purifying (or negative)
	selection, neutral evolution, and diversifying (or positive) selection,
	respectively. The omega ratio is commonly calculated as an average
	over sites. As every functional protein has some amino acid sites
	under selective constraints, averaging rates across sites leads to
	low power to detect positive selection. Recently developed models
	of codon substitution allow the omega ratio to vary among sites and
	appear to be powerful in detecting positive selection in empirical
	data analysis. In this study, we used computer simulation to investigate
	the accuracy and power of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) in detecting
	positive selection at amino acid sites. The test compares two nested
	models: one that allows for sites under positive selection (with
	omega > 1), and another that does not, with the chi2 distribution
	used for significance testing. We found that use of the chi(2) distribution
	makes the test conservative, especially when the data contain very
	short and highly similar sequences. Nevertheless, the LRT is powerful.
	Although the power can be low with only 5 or 6 sequences in the data,
	it was nearly 100\% in data sets of 17 sequences. Sequence length,
	sequence divergence, and the strength of positive selection also
	were found to affect the power of the LRT. The exact distribution
	assumed for the omega ratio over sites was found not to affect the
	effectiveness of the LRT.},

	(aLRT) for branches is presented here as a competitive alternative
	to nonparametric bootstrap and Bayesian estimation of branch support.
	The aLRT is based on the idea of the conventional LRT, with the null
	hypothesis corresponding to the assumption that the inferred branch
	has length 0. We show that the LRT statistic is asymptotically distributed
	as a maximum of three random variables drawn from the chi(0)2 + chi(1)2
	distribution. The new aLRT of interior branch uses this distribution
	for significance testing, but the test statistic is approximated
	in a slightly conservative but practical way as 2(l1- l2), i.e.,
	double the difference between the maximum log-likelihood values corresponding
	to the best tree and the second best topological arrangement around
	the branch of interest. Such a test is fast because the log-likelihood
	value l2 is computed by optimizing only over the branch of interest
	and the four adjacent branches, whereas other parameters are fixed
	at their optimal values corresponding to the best ML tree. The performance
	of the new test was studied on simulated 4-, 12-, and 100-taxon data
	sets with sequences of different lengths. The aLRT is shown to be

	in population data, no unique tree topology can describe the evolutionary
	history of the whole sequence. This violation of assumptions raises
	serious concerns about the likelihood method for detecting positive

	of the likelihood-ratio test (LRT) for positive selection in the

	models of variable selective pressures among sites. Sequences are
	simulated using a coalescent model with recombination and analyzed
	using codon-based likelihood models ignoring recombination. We find
	that the LRT is robust to low levels of recombination (with fewer
	than three recombination events in the history of a sample of 10
	sequences). However, at higher levels of recombination, the type
	I error rate can be as high as 90\%, especially when the null model
	in the LRT is unrealistic, and the test often mistakes recombination
	as evidence for positive selection. The test that compares the more
	realistic models M7 (beta) against M8 (beta and omega) is more robust
	to recombination, where the null model M7 allows the positive selection
	pressure to vary between 0 and 1 (and so does not account for positive
	selection), and the alternative model M8 allows an additional discrete
	class with omega = d(N)/d(S) that could be estimated to be >1 (and
	thus accounts for positive selection). Identification of sites under
	positive selection by the empirical Bayes method appears to be less
	affected than the LRT by recombination.},

	the topologies are equidistant from the true but unknown topology.
	This composite hypothesis can either be reduced to the simple hypothesis
	at the least favorable distribution (frequentist significance test
	[FST]) or to the maximum likelihood topology (frequentist hypothesis
	test [FHT]). In both cases, the reduced null hypothesis is tested
	against each topology included in the analysis. The tests proposed
	have an information-theoretic justification, and the distribution
	of their test statistic is estimated by a nonparametric bootstrap,
	adjusting P-values for multiple comparisons. I applied the new tests
	to the reanalysis of two chloroplast genes, psaA and psbB, and compared
	the results with those of previously described tests. As expected,
	the FST and the FHT behaved approximately like the Shimodaira-Hasegawa

	the size of all the tests is affected by misspecification, the two

	approach to describe the change of evolutionary rate over time. Analysis
	of 22 genes from the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes under

	records. In particular, the date of protostome-deuterostome divergence
	was on average 582 +/- 112 MYA. These results were found to be robust
	to specification of the model of rate change. The clock assumption
	thus had a dramatic effect on date estimation. However, our results
	appeared sensitive to the prior model of cladogenesis, although the
	oldest estimates (791 +/- 246 MYA) were obtained under a suboptimal
	model. Bayes posterior estimates of evolutionary rates indicated
	at least one major burst of molecular evolution at the end of the
	Precambrian when protostomes and deuterostomes diverged. We stress

	this assumption is often violated and has drastic effects on date
	estimation. Recently, a number of attempts have been made to relax
	the clock assumption. One approach is to use maximum likelihood,
	which assigns rates to branches and allows the estimation of both
	rates and times. An alternative is the Bayes approach, which models
	the change of the rate over time. A number of models of rate change
	have been proposed. We have extended and evaluated models of rate
	evolution, i.e., the lognormal and its recent variant, along with
	the gamma, the exponential, and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.
	These models were first applied to a small hominoid data set, where
	an empirical Bayes approach was used to estimate the hyperparameters
	that measure the amount of rate variation. Estimation of divergence
	times was sensitive to these hyperparameters, especially when the
	assumed model is close to the clock assumption. The rate and date
	estimates varied little from model to model, although the posterior
	Bayes factor indicated the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process outperformed
	the other models. To demonstrate the importance of allowing for rate
	change across lineages, this general approach was used to analyze
	a larger data set consisting of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene of 39
	metazoan species. We obtained date estimates consistent with paleontological
	records, the deepest split within the group being about 560 million
	years ago. Estimates of the rates were in accordance with the Cambrian

	25,000 aa positions for 30 species by using maximum-likelihood approaches.
	All well-established eukaryotic groups were recovered with high statistical

	lineages strongly clustered together in agreement with the Conosa
	hypothesis [as defined by T. Cavalier-Smith (1998) Biol. Rev. Cambridge

  abstract = {Stability of the native state is an essential requirement in protein
	evolution and design. Here we investigated the interplay between
	chain length and stability constraints using a simple model of protein
	folding and a statistical study of the Protein Data Bank. We distinguish
	two types of stability of the native state: with respect to the unfolded
	state (unfolding stability) and with respect to misfolded configurations
	(misfolding stability). Several contributions to stability are evaluated
	and their correlations are disentangled through principal components
	analysis, with the following main results. (1) We show that longer
	proteins can fulfil more easily the requirements of unfolding and
	misfolding stability, because they have a higher number of native
	interactions per residue. Consistently, in longer proteins native
	interactions are weaker and they are less optimized with respect
	to non-native interactions. (2) Stability against misfolding is negatively
	correlated with the strength of native interactions, which is related
	to hydrophobicity. Hence there is a trade-off between unfolding and
	misfolding stability. This trade-off is influenced by protein length:
	less hydrophobic sequences are observed in very long proteins. (3)
	The number of disulfide bonds is positively correlated with the deficit
	of free energy stabilizing the native state. Chain length and the
	number of disulfide bonds per residue are negatively correlated in
	proteins with short chains and uncorrelated in proteins with long
	chains. (4) The number of salt bridges per residue and per native
	contact increases with chain length. We interpret these observations
	as an indication that the constraints imposed by unfolding stability
	are less demanding in long proteins and they are further reduced
	by the competing requirement for stability against misfolding. In
	particular, disulfide bonds appear to be positively selected in short
	proteins, whereas they evolve in an effectively neutral way in long
	proteins.},

  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {43},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since thermodynamic stability is a global property of
	proteins that has to be conserved during evolution, the selective
	pressure at a given site of a protein sequence depends on the amino
	acids present at other sites. However, models of molecular evolution
	that aim at reconstructing the evolutionary history of macromolecules
	become computationally intractable if such correlations between sites
	are explicitly taken into account. RESULTS: We introduce an evolutionary
	model with sites evolving independently under a global constraint
	on the conservation of structural stability. This model consists
	of a selection process, which depends on two hydrophobicity parameters
	that can be computed from protein sequences without any fit, and
	a mutation process for which we consider various models. It reproduces
	quantitatively the results of Structurally Constrained Neutral (SCN)
	simulations of protein evolution in which the stability of the native
	state is explicitly computed and conserved. We then compare the predicted
	site-specific amino acid distributions with those sampled from the
	Protein Data Bank (PDB). The parameters of the mutation model, whose
	number varies between zero and five, are fitted from the data. The
	mean correlation coefficient between predicted and observed site-specific
	amino acid distributions is larger than <r> = 0.70 for a mutation
	model with no free parameters and no genetic code. In contrast, considering
	only the mutation process with no selection yields a mean correlation
	coefficient of <r> = 0.56 with three fitted parameters. The mutation
	model that best fits the data takes into account increased mutation
	rate at CpG dinucleotides, yielding <r> = 0.90 with five parameters.
	CONCLUSION: The effective selection process that we propose reproduces
	well amino acid distributions as observed in the protein sequences
	in the PDB. Its simplicity makes it very promising for likelihood
	calculations in phylogenetic studies. Interestingly, in this approach
	the mutation process influences the effective selection process,
	i.e. selection and mutation must be entangled in order to obtain
	effectively independent sites. This interdependence between mutation
	and selection reflects the deep influence that mutation has on the
	evolutionary process: The bias in the mutation influences the thermodynamic
	properties of the evolving proteins, in agreement with comparative
	studies of bacterial proteomes, and it also influences the rate of
	accepted mutations.},

	are represented by the principal eigenvector (PE) of the protein
	contact matrix, a quantity that resembles closely the effective connectivity
	of each site; sequences are represented through the "interactivity"
	of each amino acid type, using novel parameters that are correlated
	with hydropathy scales. These interactivity parameters are more strongly
	correlated than the other hydropathy scales that we examine with:
	(1) the change upon mutations of the unfolding free energy of proteins

	Using this result, we derive an analytic expression for site-specific

	domains is crucial for functional annotation and correct classification
	of newly discovered proteins. Conventional Multiple Sequence Alignment
	(MSA) based methods find difficulties when faced with heterogeneous
	groups of proteins. However, even many families of proteins that
	do share a common domain contain instances of several other domains,
	without any common underlying linear ordering. Ignoring this modularity
	may lead to poor or even false classification results. An automated
	method that can analyze a group of proteins into the sequence domains
	it contains is therefore highly desirable. RESULTS: We apply a novel
	method to the problem of protein domain detection. The method takes
	as input an unaligned group of protein sequences. It segments them
	and clusters the segments into groups sharing the same underlying
	statistics. A Variable Memory Markov (VMM) model is built using a
	Prediction Suffix Tree (PST) data structure for each group of segments.
	Refinement is achieved by letting the PSTs compete over the segments,
	and a deterministic annealing framework infers the number of underlying
	PST models while avoiding many inferior solutions. We show that regions
	of similar statistics correlate well with protein sequence domains,
	by matching a unique signature to each domain. This is done in a
	fully automated manner, and does not require or attempt an MSA. Several
	representative cases are analyzed. We identify a protein fusion event,
	refine an HMM superfamily classification into the underlying families
	the HMM cannot separate, and detect all 12 instances of a short domain

	factors to specific sites located in the regulatory region of the
	gene. The generation of these binding sites and of cooperativity
	between them are essential building blocks in the evolution of complex
	regulatory networks. We study a theoretical model for the sequence
	evolution of binding sites by point mutations. The approach is based
	on biophysical models for the binding of transcription factors to
	DNA. Hence we derive empirically grounded fitness landscapes, which
	enter a population genetics model including mutations, genetic drift,
	and selection. RESULTS: We show that the selection for factor binding
	generically leads to specific correlations between nucleotide frequencies
	at different positions of a binding site. We demonstrate the possibility
	of rapid adaptive evolution generating a new binding site for a given
	transcription factor by point mutations. The evolutionary time required
	is estimated in terms of the neutral (background) mutation rate,
	the selection coefficient, and the effective population size. CONCLUSIONS:
	The efficiency of binding site formation is seen to depend on two
	joint conditions: the binding site motif must be short enough and
	the promoter region must be long enough. These constraints on promoter
	architecture are indeed seen in eukaryotic systems. Furthermore,
	we analyse the adaptive evolution of genetic switches and of signal
	integration through binding cooperativity between different sites.
	Experimental tests of this picture involving the statistics of polymorphisms

  abstract = {The vertebrate genome is a mosaic of GC-poor and GC-rich isochores,
	megabase-sized DNA regions of fairly homogeneous base composition
	that differ in relative amount, gene density, gene expression, replication
	timing, and recombination frequency. At the emergence of warm-blooded
	vertebrates, the gene-rich, moderately GC-rich isochores of the cold-blooded
	ancestors underwent a GC increase. This increase was similar in mammals
	and birds and was maintained during the evolution of mammalian and
	avian orders. Neither the GC increase nor its conservation can be
	accounted for by the random fixation of neutral or nearly neutral
	single-nucleotide changes (i.e., the vast majority of nucleotide
	substitutions) or by a biased gene conversion process occurring at
	random genome locations. Both phenomena can be explained, however,
	by the neoselectionist theory of genome evolution that is presented
	here. This theory fully accepts Ohta's nearly neutral view of point
	mutations but proposes in addition (i) that the AT-biased mutational
	input present in vertebrates pushes some DNA regions below a certain
	GC threshold; (ii) that these lower GC levels cause regional changes
	in chromatin structure that lead to deleterious effects on replication
	and transcription; and (iii) that the carriers of these changes undergo
	negative (purifying) selection, the final result being a compositional
	conservation of the original isochore pattern in the surviving population.
	Negative selection may also largely explain the GC increase accompanying
	the emergence of warm-blooded vertebrates. In conclusion, the neoselectionist
	theory not only provides a solution to the neutralist/selectionist
	debate but also introduces an epigenomic component in genome evolution.},

  abstract = {The tailoring of existing genetic systems to new uses is called genetic
	co-option. Mechanisms of genetic co-option have been difficult to
	study because of difficulties in identifying functionally important
	changes. One way to study genetic co-option in protein-coding genes
	is to identify those amino acid sites that have experienced changes
	in selective pressure following a genetic co-option event. In this
	paper we present a maximum likelihood method useful for measuring
	divergent selective pressures and identifying the amino acid sites
	affected by divergent selection. The method is based on a codon model
	of evolution and uses the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate ratio
	(omega) as a measure of selection on the protein, with omega = 1,
	< 1, and > 1 indicating neutral evolution, purifying selection, and
	positive selection, respectively. The model allows variation in omega
	among sites, with a fraction of sites evolving under divergent selective
	pressures. Divergent selection is indicated by different omega's
	between clades, such as between paralogous clades of a gene family.
	We applied the codon model to duplication followed by functional
	divergence of (i) the epsilon and gamma globin genes and (ii) the
	eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin
	(EDN) genes. In both cases likelihood ratio tests suggested the presence
	of sites evolving under divergent selective pressures. Results of
	the epsilon and gamma globin analysis suggested that divergent selective
	pressures might be a consequence of a weakened relationship between
	fetal hemoglobin and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. We suggest that empirical
	Bayesian identification of sites evolving under divergent selective
	pressures, combined with structural and functional information, can
	provide a valuable framework for identifying and studying mechanisms
	of genetic co-option. Limitations of the new method are discussed.},

	the incorrect assumption of all previously described methods that
	the divergence between two present-day sequences is twice the divergence

	estimation of ancestral sequence composition and, if applicable,
	of different substitution rates for the two descendant lineages,

	Properties of the Markov chain were discussed. It was proved for

	rates to the two descendant lineages when four or more similar sequences

	As in CAT, the model implements a mixture of distinct Markovian processes

	selective constraints induced by protein structure and function.
	Furthermore, as in BP, these processes are nonstationary, and their

	residues to be more conserved, proteins with a higher fraction of
	buried residues, nonetheless, tend to evolve their sequences more
	rapidly. We suggest that this effect is due to the increased designability

	rate of accepted point mutation. During the computation of phylogenetic
	likelihoods, rate heterogeneity can be modeled on a site-per-site
	basis with relative rates drawn from a discretized Gamma-distribution.
	Site-rate estimates (e.g., the rate of highest posterior probability
	given the data at a site) can then be used as a measure of evolutionary
	constraints imposed by function. However, if the sequence availability
	is limited, the estimation of rates is subject to sampling error.
	This article presents a simulation study that evaluates the robustness
	of evolutionary site-rate estimates for both small and phylogenetically
	unbalanced samples. The sampling error on rate estimates was first
	evaluated for alignments that included 5-45 sequences, sampled by
	jackknifing, from a master alignment containing 968 sequences. We
	observed that the potentially enhanced resolution among site rates
	due to the inclusion of a larger number of rate categories is negated
	by the difficulty in correctly estimating intermediate rates. This
	effect is marked for data sets with less than 30 sequences. Although
	the computation of likelihood theoretically accounts for phylogenetic
	distances through branch lengths, the introduction of a single long-branch
	outlier sequence had a significant negative effect on site-rate estimates.
	Finally, the presence of a shift in rates of evolution between related
	lineages can be diagnostic of a gain/loss of function within a protein
	family. Our analyses indicate that detecting these rate shifts is
	a harder problem than estimating rates. This is so, partially, because
	the difference in rates depends on two rate estimates, each with
	an intrinsic uncertainty. The performances of four methods to detect
	these site-rate shifts are evaluated and compared. Guidelines are
	suggested for preparing data sets minimally influenced by error introduced

  abstract = {Gene duplication is considered an important evolutionary mechanism
	leading to new gene functions. According to the classical model,
	one gene copy arising from gene duplication retains the ancestral
	function, whilst the other becomes subject to directional selection
	for some novel functions. Hence, according to this model, long-term
	persistence of two paralogous genes is possible only with the acquisition
	of functional innovation. In the absence of neofunctionalization,
	one of the duplicate genes may be lost following accumulation of
	deleterious mutations, ultimately leading to the loss of function.
	Recently, new mechanisms have been proposed according to which both
	paralogs are maintained without apparent neofunctionalization. In
	this paper we describe the molecular evolution of the aspartic proteinase
	gene family, with particular regard for the nothepsin gene, a sex-
	and tissue-specific form of aspartic proteinase active in fish. The
	finding of nothepsin in a reptile is indicative of the presence of
	this gene in organisms other than fish. However, the failure to find
	any nothepsin-like gene in avian, murine and human genome suggests
	that the gene has been lost in certain lineages during evolution.
	At variance with piscine nothepsin expressed exclusively in female
	liver under the estrogens action, the reptilian counterpart lacks
	both tissue and sex specificity, as it is constitutively expressed
	in different tissues of male and female specimens. The expression
	of the nothepsin gene in fish and lizard is accompanied by the expression
	of a paralogous gene encoding for cathepsin D. Functional divergence
	analysis indicates that cathepsin D accumulated amino acid substitutions,
	whereas nothepsin retained most of the ancestral functions. Phylogenetic
	analysis shows a preponderance of replacement substitutions compared
	to silent substitutions in the branch leading to the cathepsin D
	clade, whilst nothepsin evolves under negative selection. To explain
	the loss of the nothepsin gene in certain lineages, we propose a
	model that takes into account the complementary degenerative mutations
	occurring in regulatory elements of the promoter regions of the two
	genes. According to this model, gene loss occurs whenever the two
	genes acquire the same expression pattern. The coexistence of cathepsin

	the two enzymes.},

  volume = {7},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies on the distribution of indel sizes have consistently
	found that they obey a power law. This finding has lead several scientists
	to propose that logarithmic gap costs, G (k) = a + c ln k, are more
	biologically realistic than affine gap costs, G (k) = a + bk, for
	sequence alignment. Since quick and efficient affine costs are currently
	the most popular way to globally align sequences, the goal of this
	paper is to determine whether logarithmic gap costs improve alignment
	accuracy significantly enough the merit their use over the faster
	affine gap costs. RESULTS: A group of simulated sequences pairs were
	globally aligned using affine, logarithmic, and log-affine gap costs.
	Alignment accuracy was calculated by comparing resulting alignments
	to actual alignments of the sequence pairs. Gap costs were then compared
	based on average alignment accuracy. Log-affine gap costs had the
	best accuracy, followed closely by affine gap costs, while logarithmic
	gap costs performed poorly. Subsequently a model was developed to
	explain the results. CONCLUSION: In contrast to initial expectations,
	logarithmic gap costs produce poor alignments and are actually not
	implied by the power-law behavior of gap sizes, given typical match
	and mismatch costs. Furthermore, affine gap costs not only produce
	accurate alignments but are also good approximations to biologically
	realistic gap costs. This work provides added confidence for the
	biological relevance of existing alignment algorithms.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Relationships amongst taxa are inferred from biological
	data using phylogenetic methods and procedures. Very few known phylogenies
	exist against which to test the accuracy of our inferences. Therefore,
	in the absence of biological data, simulated data must be used to
	test the accuracy of methods which produce these inferences. Researchers
	have limited or non-existent options for simulations useful for studying
	the impact of insertions, deletions, and alignments on phylogenetic
	accuracy. RESULTS: To satisfy this gap I have developed a new algorithm
	of indel formation and incorporated it into a new, flexible, and
	portable application for sequence simulation. The application, called
	Dawg, simulates phylogenetic evolution of DNA sequences in continuous
	time using the robust general time reversible model with gamma and
	invariant rate heterogeneity and a novel length-dependent model of
	indel formation. On completion, Dawg produces the true alignment
	of the simulated sequences. Unlike other applications, Dawg allows
	indel lengths to be explicitly distributed via a biologically realistic
	power law. Many options are available to allow users to customize
	their simulations and results. Because simulating with indels would
	be problematic if biologically realistic parameters could not be
	estimated, a script is provided with Dawg that can estimate the parameters
	of indel formation from sequence data. Dawg was applied to the sequences
	of four chloroplast trnK introns. It was used to parametrically bootstrap
	an estimation of the rate of indel formation for the phylogeny. Because
	Dawg can assist in parametric bootstrapping of sequence data it is
	useful beyond phylogenetics, such as studying alignment algorithms
	or parameters of molecular evolution. AVAILABILITY: Dawg 1.0.0 can

	we show that transcriptional variability should be a true indicator
	of evolutionary rate. If we rule out the effect of translational
	selection, which seems to operate only in yeast, the apparent slow
	evolution of highly expressed genes should be attributed to their

	high level of transcriptional variability and contribute to phenotypic
	variations. Essentiality also seems to be correlated with the variability,
	not the activity. We show that indispensable or highly interactive
	proteins tend to be present in high abundance to maintain a low variability.
	Our results challenge the current theory that highly expressed genes
	are essential and evolve slowly. Transcriptional variability, rather
	than transcriptional activity, might be a common indicator of essentiality

	DNA methyltransferases and (2) the consequent high frequency of spontaneous
	deamination of 5-methyl cytosine (5mC) to thymidine. DNA methylation
	thus contributes significantly, albeit indirectly, to the incidence
	of human genetic disease. We have attempted to estimate for the first
	time the in vivo rate of deamination of 5mC from the measured rate
	of 5mC deamination in vitro and the known error frequency of the
	cellular G/T mismatch-repair system. The accuracy and utility of
	this estimate (md) was then assessed by comparison with clinical
	data, and an improved estimate of md (1.66 X 10(-16) s-1) was derived.
	Comparison of the CpG mutation rates exhibited by globin gene and
	pseudogene sequences from human, chimpanzee and macaque provided
	further estimates of md, all of which were consistent with the first.
	Use of this value in a mathematical model then permitted the estimation
	of the length of time required to produce the level of "CpG suppression"
	currently found in the "bulk DNA" of vertebrate genomes. This time
	span, approximately 450 million years, corresponds closely to the
	estimated time since the emergence and adaptive radiation of the
	vertebrates and thus coincides with the probable advent of heavily
	methylated genomes. An accurate estimate of the 5mC deamination rate
	is important not only for clinical medicine but also for studies
	of gene evolution. Our data suggest both that patterns of vertebrate
	gene methylation may be comparatively stable over relatively long
	periods of evolutionary time, and that the rate of CpG deamination
	can, under certain limited conditions, serve as a "molecular clock".},

	for the distributions of beneficial fitness effects and, surprisingly,
	they depend only weakly on biological details. In particular, the
	theory suggests that beneficial mutations obey an exponential distribution
	of fitness effects, with the same exponential parameter across different
	regions of genotype space, provided only that few possible beneficial
	mutations are available to that genotype. Here we tested this hypothesis
	with a quasi-empirical model of RNA evolution in which fitness is
	based on the secondary structures of molecules and their thermodynamic
	stabilities. The fitnesses of randomly selected genotypes appeared
	to follow a Gumbel-type distribution and thus conform to a basic
	assumption of adaptation theory. However, the observed distributions

	effects appeared exponential only when the vast majority of small-effect
	beneficial mutations were ignored. Additionally, the distribution
	of beneficial fitness effects varied with the fitness of the parent
	genotype. We believe that correlation of the fitness values among

	evolutionary rate is expression level, for reasons that have remained

	robustness to translational missense errors. Pressure for translational
	robustness increases with expression level and constrains sequence
	evolution. Using several sequenced yeast genomes, global expression
	and protein abundance data, and sets of paralogs traceable to an
	ancient whole-genome duplication in yeast, we rule out several confounding
	effects and show that expression level explains roughly half the
	variation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein evolutionary rates.
	We examine causes for expression's dominant role and find that genome-wide
	tests favor the translational robustness explanation over existing
	hypotheses that invoke constraints on function or translational efficiency.
	Our results suggest that proteins evolve at rates largely unrelated
	to their functions and can explain why highly expressed proteins

	mammalian gene promoter sequences is of key importance to understand
	the evolution of gene regulatory networks. The level of promoter
	conservation varies greatly across orthologous genes, denoting differences
	in the strength of the evolutionary constraints. Here we test the
	hypothesis that the number of tissues in which a gene is expressed
	is related in a significant manner to the extent of promoter sequence
	conservation. RESULTS: We show that mammalian housekeeping genes,
	expressed in all or nearly all tissues, show significantly lower
	promoter sequence conservation, especially upstream of position -500
	with respect to the transcription start site, than genes expressed
	in a subset of tissues. In addition, we evaluate the effect of gene
	function, CpG island content and protein evolutionary rate on promoter
	sequence conservation. Finally, we identify a subset of transcription
	factors that bind to motifs that are specifically over-represented
	in housekeeping gene promoters. CONCLUSION: This is the first report
	that shows that the promoters of housekeeping genes show reduced
	sequence conservation with respect to genes expressed in a more tissue-restricted
	manner. This is likely to be related to simpler gene expression,
	requiring a smaller number of functional cis-regulatory motifs.},

	 Australopithecus afarensis, which lived some 3.7 million years ago

	 Laetoli in Tanzania and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was ancestral to man
	and
	
	 evolved after the human-ape splitting. Another likelier possibility
	is
	
	 that mtDNA was transferred through hybridization between a proto-human
	and
	
	 a proto-chimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.

	AB - A new statistical method for estimating divergence dates of species
	from
	
	 DNA sequence data by a molecular clock approach is developed. This
	method
	
	 takes into account effectively the information contained in a set
	of DNA
	
	 sequence data. The molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was
	
	 calibrated by setting the date of divergence between primates and
	
	 ungulates at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (65 million years ago),
	when
	
	 the extinction of dinosaurs occurred. A generalized least-squares
	method
	
	 was applied in fitting a model to mtDNA sequence data, and the clock
	gave
	
	 dates of 92.3 +/- 11.7, 13.3 +/- 1.5, 10.9 +/- 1.2, 3.7 +/- 0.6,
	and 2.7
	
	 +/- 0.6 million years ago (where the second of each pair of numbers
	is the
	
	 standard deviation) for the separation of mouse, gibbon, orangutan,
	
	 gorilla, and chimpanzee, respectively, from the line leading to humans.
	
	 Although there is some uncertainty in the clock, this dating may
	pose a
	
	 problem for the widely believed hypothesis that the pipedal creature
	
	 Australopithecus afarensis, which lived some 3.7 million years ago
	at
	
	 Laetoli in Tanzania and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was ancestral to man
	and
	
	 evolved after the human-ape splitting. Another likelier possibility
	is
	
	 that mtDNA was transferred through hybridization between a proto-human
	and
	
	 a proto-chimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.

  abstract = {The method of Hidden Markov Models is used to allow for unequal and
	unknown evolutionary rates at different sites in molecular sequences.
	Rates of evolution at different sites are assumed to be drawn from
	a set of possible rates, with a finite number of possibilities. The
	overall likelihood of phylogeny is calculated as a sum of terms,
	each term being the probability of the data given a particular assignment
	of rates to sites, times the prior probability of that particular
	combination of rates. The probabilities of different rate combinations
	are specified by a stationary Markov chain that assigns rate categories
	to sites. While there will be a very large number of possible ways
	of assigning rates to sites, a simple recursive algorithm allows
	the contributions to the likelihood from all possible combinations
	of rates to be summed, in a time proportional to the number of different
	rates at a single site. Thus with three rates, the effort involved
	is no greater than three times that for a single rate. This "Hidden
	Markov Model" method allows for rates to differ between sites and
	for correlations between the rates of neighboring sites. By summing
	over all possibilities it does not require us to know the rates at
	individual sites. However, it does not allow for correlation of rates
	at nonadjacent sites, nor does it allow for a continuous distribution
	of rates over sites. It is shown how to use the Newton-Raphson method
	to estimate branch lengths of a phylogeny and to infer from a phylogeny
	what assignment of rates to sites has the largest posterior probability.
	An example is given using beta-hemoglobin DNA sequences in eight
	mammal species; the regions of high and low evolutionary rates are
	inferred and also the average length of patches of similar rates.},

  abstract = {The detection of positive Darwinian selection affecting protein-coding
	genes remains a topic of great interest and importance. The "branch-site"
	test is designed to detect localized episodic bouts of positive selection
	that affect only a few amino-acid residues on particular lineages,
	and has been shown to have reasonable power and low false positive
	rates for a wide range of selection schemes. Previous simulations
	examining the performance of the test, however, were conducted under
	idealized conditions without insertions, deletions or alignment errors.
	As the test is sometimes used to analyze divergent sequences, the
	impact of indels and alignment errors is a major concern. Here we
	used a recently developed indel-simulation program to examine the
	false-positive rate and power of the branch-site test. We find that
	insertions and deletions do not cause excessive false positives if
	the alignment is correct, but alignment errors can lead to unacceptably
	high false positives. Of the alignment methods evaluated, PRANK consistently
	outperformed MUSCLE, MAFFT and ClustalW, mostly because the latter
	programs tend to place non-homologous codons (or amino-acids) into
	the same column, producing shorter and less accurate alignments and
	giving the false impression that many amino acid substitutions have
	occurred at those sites. Our examination of two previous studies
	suggests that alignment errors may impact the analysis of mammalian
	and vertebrate genes by the branch-site test and it is important
	to use reliable alignment methods.},

  abstract = {Riboflavin, an essential cofactor for all organisms, is biosynthesized
	in plants, fungi and microorganisms. The penultimate step in the
	pathway is catalyzed by the enzyme lumazine synthase. One of the
	most distinctive characteristics of this enzyme is that it is found
	in different species in two different quaternary structures, pentameric
	and icosahedral, built from practically the same structural monomeric
	unit. In fact, the icosahedral structure is best described as a capsid
	of twelve pentamers. Despite this noticeable difference, the active
	sites are virtually identical in all structurally studied members.
	Furthermore, the main regions involved in the catalysis are located
	at the interface between adjacent subunits in the pentamer. Thus,
	the two quaternary forms of the enzyme must meet similar structural
	requirements to achieve their function, but, at the same time, they
	should differ in the sequence traits responsible for the different
	quaternary structures observed. Here, we present a combined analysis
	that includes sequence-structure and evolutionary studies to find
	the sequence determinants of the different quaternary assemblies
	of this enzyme. A data set containing 86 sequences of the lumazine
	synthase family was recovered by sequence similarity searches. Seven
	of them had resolved three-dimensional structures. A subsequent phylogenetic
	reconstruction by maximum parsimony (MP) allowed division of the
	total set into two clusters in accord with their quaternary structure.
	The comparison between the patterns of three-dimensional contacts
	derived from the known three-dimensional structures and variation
	in sequence conservation revealed a significant shift in structural
	constraints of certain positions. Also, to explore the changes in
	functional constraints between the two groups, site-specific evolutionary
	rate shifts were analyzed. We found that the positions involved in
	icosahedral contacts suffer a larger increase in constraints than
	the rest. We found eight sequence sites that would be the most important
	icosahedral sequence determinants. We discuss our results and compare
	them with previous work. These findings should contribute to refinement
	of the current structural data, to the design of assays that explore
	the role of these positions, to the structural characterization of
	new sequences, and to initiation of a study of the underlying evolutionary

	using core histones, the histone chaperone NAP-1, and ATP-dependent
	chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (ACF). The mechanical properties
	of these complexes were interrogated by stretching them with optical
	tweezers. Abrupt events releasing approximately 55-95 base-pairs
	of DNA, attributable to the non-equilibrium unraveling of individual
	nucleosomes, were frequently observed. This finding is comparable
	with a previous observation of 72-80 bp unraveling events for nucleosomes
	assembled by salt dialysis on a repeating sea urchin 5 S RNA positioning
	element, but the unraveling force varied over a wider range ( approximately
	5-65 pN, with the majority of events at lower force). Because ACF
	assembles nucleosomes uniformly on heterogeneous DNA sequences, as
	in native chromatin, we attribute this variation to a dependence
	of the unraveling force on the DNA sequence within individual nucleosomes.
	The mean force increased from 24 pN to 31 pN as NaCl was decreased
	from 100 mM to 5 mM. Spontaneous DNA re-wrapping events were occasionally
	observed in real time during force relaxation. The observed wide
	variations in the dynamic force needed to unravel individual nucleosomes

	account unequal mutation rates among different nucleotides and purifying
	selection. This model is constructed by using a 61 X 61 transition
	probability matrix for the 61 nonterminating codons. Under this model,
	a computer simulation is conducted to study the numbers of silent
	(synonymous) and amino acid-altering (nonsynonymous) nucleotide substitutions
	when the underlying mutation rates among the four kinds of nucleotides
	are not equal. It is assumed that the substitution rates are constant
	over evolutionary time, the codon frequencies being in equilibrium,
	and, thus, the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions
	both increase linearly with evolutionary time. It is shown that,
	when the mutation rates are not equal, the estimate of synonymous
	substitutions obtained by F. Perler, A. Efstratiadis, P. Lomedico,
	W. Gilbert, R. Kolodner and J. Dodgson's "Percent Corrected Divergence"
	method increases nonlinearly, although the true number of synonymous
	substitutions increases linearly. It is, therefore, possible that
	the "saturation" of synonymous substitutions observed by Perler et
	al. is due to the inefficiency of their method to detect all synonymous
	substitutions.},

	current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast

	approach, based on the maximum- likelihood principle, which clearly
	satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a simple
	hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths
	simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built
	by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve
	its likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment

	higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches.
	The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other
	maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability
	tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard

  abstract = {There are many examples of RNA molecules in which the secondary structure
	has been strongly conserved during evolution, but the base sequence
	is much less conserved, e.g., transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, and ribonuclease
	P. A model of compensatory neutral mutations is used here to describe
	the evolution of the base sequence in RNA helices. There are two
	loci (i.e., the two sides of the pair) with four alleles at each
	locus (corresponding to A, C, G, U). Watson-Crick base pairs (AU,
	CG, GC, and UA) are each assigned a fitness 1, whilst all other pairs
	are treated as mismatches and assigned fitness 1-s. A population
	of N diploid individuals is considered with a mutation rate of u
	per base. For biologically reasonable parameter values, the frequency
	of mismatches is always small but the frequency of the four matching
	pairs can vary over a wide range. Using a diffusion model, the stationary
	distribution for the frequency x of any of the four matching pairs
	is calculated. The shape depends on the combination of variables
	beta = 8Nu2/9s. For small beta, the distribution diverges at the
	two extremes, x = 0 and x = 1-z, where z is the mean frequency of
	mismatches. The population typically consists almost entirely of
	one of the four types of matching pairs, but occasionally makes shifts
	between the four possible states. The mean rate at which these shifts
	occur is calculated here. The effect of recombination between the
	two loci is to decrease the probability density at intermediate x,
	and to increase the weight at the extremes. The rate of transition
	between the four states is slowed by recombination (as originally
	shown by Kimura in a two-allele model with irreversible mutation).
	A very small recombination rate r approximately u2/s is sufficient
	to increase the mean time between transitions dramatically. In addition
	to its application to RNA, this model is also relevant to the 'shifting
	balance' theory describing the drift of populations between alternative
	equilibria separated by low fitness valleys. Equilibrium values for
	the frequencies of the different allele combinations in an infinite
	population are also calculated. It is shown that for low recombination
	rates the equilibrium is symmetric, but there is a critical recombination
	rate above which alternative asymmetric equilibria become stable.},

	amino acid substitutions, then the rate of evolution should be greater
	in proteins that contribute less to individual fitness. The rationale
	for this prediction is that relatively dispensable proteins should
	be subject to weaker purifying selection, and should therefore accumulate
	mildly deleterious substitutions more rapidly. Although this argument
	was presented over twenty years ago, and is fundamental to many applications
	of evolutionary theory, the prediction has proved difficult to confirm.
	In fact, a recent study showed that essential mouse genes do not
	evolve more slowly than non-essential ones. Thus, although a variety
	of factors influencing the rate of protein evolution have been supported
	by extensive sequence analysis, the relationship between protein
	dispensability and evolutionary rate has remained unconfirmed. Here
	we use the results from a highly parallel growth assay of single
	gene deletions in yeast to assess protein dispensability, which we
	relate to evolutionary rate estimates that are based on comparisons
	of sequences drawn from twenty-one fully annotated genomes. Our analysis
	reveals a highly significant relationship between protein dispensability
	and evolutionary rate, and explains why this relationship is not
	detectable by categorical comparison of essential versus non-essential
	proteins. The relationship is highly conserved, so that protein dispensability

	frequency, but there have been few studies into their accuracy. We
	tested the accuracy of several relaxed-clock methods (penalized likelihood
	and Bayesian inference using various models of rate change) using
	nucleotide sequences simulated on a nine-taxon tree. When the sequences
	evolved with a constant rate, the methods were able to infer rates
	accurately, but estimates were more precise when a molecular clock
	was assumed. When the sequences evolved under a model of auto-correlated
	rate change, rates were accurately estimated using penalized likelihood

	of rate change, while other models did not perform as well. When
	the sequences evolved under a model of uncorrelated rate change,
	only Bayesian inference using an exponential rate model performed
	well. Collectively, the results provide a strong recommendation for
	using the exponential model of rate change if a conservative approach
	to divergence time estimation is required. A case study is presented
	in which we use a simulation-based approach to examine the hypothesis
	of elevated rates in the Cambrian period, and it is found that these

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying functional elements, such as transcriptional

	a novel and flexible model, the Optimized Mixture Markov model (OMiMa),
	and related methods to allow adjustment of model complexity for different
	motifs. In comparison with other leading methods, OMiMa can incorporate
	more than the NNSplice's pairwise dependencies; OMiMa avoids model
	over-fitting better than the Permuted Variable Length Markov Model
	(PVLMM); and OMiMa requires smaller training samples than the Maximum
	Entropy Model (MEM). Testing on both simulated and actual data (regulatory
	cis-elements and splice sites), we found OMiMa's performance superior
	to the other leading methods in terms of prediction accuracy, required
	size of training data or computational time. Our OMiMa system, to
	our knowledge, is the only motif finding tool that incorporates automatic
	selection of the best model. OMiMa is freely available at 1. CONCLUSION:
	Our optimized mixture of Markov models represents an alternative
	to the existing methods for modeling dependent structures within

	However, it is unclear which probability distribution should be used
	to describe how the nonsynonymous rate of substitution varies across

	in accommodating different potential distributions for the nonsynonymous

	alignment without introducing superfluous parameters. A number of
	methods have been used to choose among a small set of candidate substitution
	models, such as the likelihood ratio test, the Akaike Information

	factors. Current implementations of any of these criteria suffer
	from the limitation that only a small set of models are examined,
	or that the test does not allow easy comparison of non-nested models.
	In this article, we expand the pool of candidate substitution models
	to include all possible time-reversible models. This set includes
	seven models that have already been described. We show how Bayes
	factors can be calculated for these models using reversible jump
	Markov chain Monte Carlo, and apply the method to 16 DNA sequence
	alignments. For each data set, we compare the model with the best

  abstract = {The class I major histocompatibility complex genes are composed of
	classical and nonclassical genes, the latter being largely nonfunctional.
	To understand the evolutionary relationships of the two groups of
	class I genes, a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences was conducted
	using 45 genes from six mammalian and one avian species. The results
	indicate that nonclassical genes in one species are more closely
	related to classical genes from the same species than to nonclassical
	genes from a species belonging to a different order or family. This
	indicates that the differentiation of classical and nonclassical
	genes occurs rather rapidly in the genome. Classical genes are apparently
	duplicated with a high frequency in the evolutionary process, and
	many of the duplicated genes seem to degenerate into nonclassical
	genes as a result of deleterious mutation. The nonclassical Qa genes
	in the mouse have sequences homologous to regulatory sequences involved
	in the universal expression of classical class I genes, but they
	have accumulated numerous nucleotide substitutions in these sequences.
	The pattern of nucleotide substitution in nonclassical genes is different
	from that in classical genes. In nonclassical genes, the rate of
	nonsynonymous substitution is higher in the antigen recognition site
	than in other gene regions, as is true of classical genes. However,
	unlike the case of classical genes, the nonsynonymous rate does not
	always exceed the synonymous rate in the antigen recognition site.
	Nonclassical proteins further differ from classical proteins in having
	amino acid replacements in conserved antigen recognition site positions.
	These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that nonclassical
	genes have originated from classical genes but have lost classical
	class I function because of deleterious mutation.},

  abstract = {Certain major-histocompatibility-complex (MHC) loci are highly polymorphic,
	and the mechanism of maintenance of this polymorphism remains controversial.
	Recent studies of the pattern of nucleotide substitution at MHC loci
	have produced strong evidence that this polymorphism is maintained
	mainly by positive Darwinian selection that operates on the antigen
	recognition site (ARS) of the MHC molecule. The ARS of the class
	I MHC consists of three subregions: (1) the binding cleft, (2) T-cell-receptor-directed
	residues, and (3) outward-directed residues. Here we report that
	the rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution is much higher
	in the binding cleft than in the other ARS subregions. Furthermore,
	nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions that result in a change of
	residue side-chain charge occur significantly more frequently than
	expected by chance. We conclude that the main target of positive
	selection on the class I MHC molecules is the binding cleft of the
	ARS and that this selection acts primarily to promote diversity among
	alleles with respect to the pattern of residue side-chain charges
	(charge profile) in the binding cleft. These results provide additional
	support for the hypothesis that MHC polymorphism is maintained by
	overdominant selection relating to antigen-binding capacity and thus
	to disease resistance.},

	elevated in overlap regions in comparison to non-overlap regions.

	that ectopic expression of OsMADS1 in rice also results in early
	flowering. To further investigate the role of OsMADS1 during rice
	flower development, we generated transgenic rice plants expressing
	altered OsMADS1 genes that contain missense mutations in the MADS
	domain. There was no visible alteration in the transgenic plants
	during the vegetative stage. However, transgenic panicles typically
	exhibited phenotypic alterations, including spikelets consisting

	hull, two pairs of leafy palea-like and lemma-like lodicules, a decrease
	in stamen number, and an increase in the number of carpels. In addition,

	These characteristics are very similar to those of leafy hull sterile1
	(lhs1). The map position of OsMADS1 is closely linked to that of
	lhs1 on chromosome 3. Examination of lhs1 revealed that it contains
	two missense mutations in the OsMADS1 MADS domain. A genetic complementation
	experiment showed that the 11.9-kb genomic DNA fragment containing
	the wild-type OsMADS1 gene rescued the mutant phenotypes. In addition,
	ectopic expression of the OsMADS1 gene isolated from the lhs1 line

	for addressing several questions in genetics, including the nature

	Properties of the DFE can be inferred by comparing the distributions
	of the frequencies of segregating nucleotide polymorphisms at selected
	and neutral sites in a population sample, but demographic changes
	alter the spectrum of allele frequencies at both neutral and selected
	sites, so can bias estimates of the DFE if not accounted for. We
	have developed a maximum-likelihood approach, based on the expected
	allele-frequency distribution generated by transition matrix methods,
	to estimate parameters of the DFE while simultaneously estimating
	parameters of a demographic model that allows a population size change
	at some time in the past. We tested the method using simulations
	and found that it accurately recovers simulated parameter values,
	even if the simulated demography differs substantially from that
	assumed in our analysis. We use our method to estimate parameters
	of the DFE for amino acid-changing mutations in humans and Drosophila
	melanogaster. For a model of unconditionally deleterious mutations,
	with effects sampled from a gamma distribution, the mean estimate
	for the distribution shape parameter is approximately 0.2 for human
	populations, which implies that the DFE is strongly leptokurtic.
	For Drosophila populations, we estimate that the shape parameter
	is approximately 0.35. Differences in the shape of the distribution
	and the mean selection coefficient between humans and Drosophila
	result in significantly more strongly deleterious mutations in Drosophila
	than in humans, and, conversely, nearly neutral mutations are significantly
	less frequent.},

	to a previously unknown property of H2B to interact with DNA in a
	periodic manner. Moreover, we found that each of the individual core
	histones, but not histone H1 or high mobility group protein 1, bound
	to the knirps enhancer to give a repetitive DNase I footprint pattern
	with a periodicity of about 10 base pairs, which is approximately
	one turn of the DNA helix. In addition, preparations containing the
	core histones H2A-H2B or H3-H4 yielded identical periodic DNase I
	footprint patterns on several different promoter and enhancer regions.
	These findings suggest that there are periodic, homotypic interactions
	between DNA-bound core histones that result from an alteration of
	the overall DNA structure such as the curvature rather than a specific
	sequence. We have also shown that histones H2A-H2B can repress initiation
	of transcription by RNA polymerase II. The phenomena described here
	may reflect histone-DNA interactions in non-nucleosomal stretches

	be generated with subnucleosomal components. It will thus be necessary

	the fractions of nucleotide sites showing type I and type II differences

	rate per year is then given by k = K/(2T), where T is the time since
	the divergence of the two sequences. If only the third codon positions

  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {326},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of protein design is to predict amino-acid sequences
	compatible with a given target structure. Traditionally envisioned
	as a purely thermodynamic question, this problem can also be understood
	in a wider context, where additional constraints are captured by
	learning the sequence patterns displayed by natural proteins of known
	conformation. In this latter perspective, however, we still need
	a theoretical formalization of the question, leading to general and
	efficient learning methods, and allowing for the selection of fast
	and accurate objective functions quantifying sequence/structure compatibility.
	RESULTS: We propose a formulation of the protein design problem in
	terms of model-based statistical inference. Our framework uses the
	maximum likelihood principle to optimize the unknown parameters of
	a statistical potential, which we call an inverse potential to contrast
	with classical potentials used for structure prediction. We propose
	an implementation based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, in which the
	likelihood is maximized by gradient descent and is numerically estimated
	by thermodynamic integration. The fit of the models is evaluated
	by cross-validation. We apply this to a simple pairwise contact potential,
	supplemented with a solvent-accessibility term, and show that the
	resulting models have a better predictive power than currently available
	pairwise potentials. Furthermore, the model comparison method presented
	here allows one to measure the relative contribution of each component
	of the potential, and to choose the optimal number of accessibility
	classes, which turns out to be much higher than classically considered.
	CONCLUSION: Altogether, this reformulation makes it possible to test
	a wide diversity of models, using different forms of potentials,
	or accounting for other factors than just the constraint of thermodynamic
	stability. Ultimately, such model-based statistical analyses may
	help to understand the forces shaping protein sequences, and driving
	their evolution.},

	of fast likelihood-based "counting methods" that employ either a
	single most likely ancestral reconstruction, weighting across all
	possible ancestral reconstructions, or sampling from ancestral reconstructions;
	(2) a random effects likelihood (REL) approach, which models variation
	in nonsynonymous and synonymous rates across sites according to a
	predefined distribution, with the selection pressure at an individual
	site inferred using an empirical Bayes approach; and (3) a fixed
	effects likelihood (FEL) method that directly estimates nonsynonymous
	and synonymous substitution rates at each site. All three methods
	incorporate flexible models of nucleotide substitution bias and variation
	in both nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates across sites,
	facilitating the comparison between the methods. We demonstrate that
	the results obtained using these approaches show broad agreement
	in levels of Type I and Type II error and in estimates of substitution
	rates. Counting methods are well suited for large alignments, for
	which there is high power to detect positive and negative selection,

	which is more computationally intensive than counting methods, has
	higher power than counting methods to detect selection in data sets

	of rate variation better than counting methods or random effects
	models, does not suffer from as many false positives as random effects
	models for data sets comprising few sequences, and can be efficiently
	parallelized. Our results suggest that previously reported differences
	between results obtained by counting methods and random effects models
	arise due to a combination of the conservative nature of counting-based
	methods, the failure of current random effects models to allow for
	variation in synonymous substitution rates, and the naive application
	of random effects models to extremely sparse data sets. We demonstrate
	our methods on sequence data from the human immunodeficiency virus

	sequence evolution. These are usually expressed in terms of a matrix
	(Q) of instantaneous rates of change but some models of amino acid
	replacement, most notably the PAM model of Dayhoff and colleagues,
	were originally published only in terms of time-dependent probability

	used eigen-decomposition of an approximation to P(t). We show that
	the commonly used value of t is too large to ensure convergence of
	the estimates of elements of Q. We describe two simpler alternative
	methods for deriving Q from information such as that published by
	Dayhoff and colleagues. Neither of these methods requires approximation
	or eigen-decomposition. We identify the methods used to derive various
	different versions of the Dayhoff model in current software, perform
	a comparison of existing and new implementations, and, to facilitate
	agreement among scientists using supposedly identical models, recommend
	that one of the new methods be used as a standard.},

  abstract = {It is accepted that many evolutionary changes of amino acid sequence
	in proteins are conservative: the replacement of one amino acid by
	another residue has a far greater chance of being accepted if the
	two residues have similar properties. It is difficult, however, to
	identify relevant physicochemical properties that capture this similarity.
	In this paper we introduce a criterion that determines similarity
	from an evolutionary point of view. Our criterion is based on the
	description of protein evolution by a Markov process and the corresponding
	matrix of instantaneous replacement rates. It is inspired by the
	conductance, a quantity that reflects the strength of mixing in a
	Markov process. Furthermore we introduce a method to divide the 20
	amino acid residues into subsets that achieve good scores with our
	criterion. The criterion has the time-invariance property that different
	time distances of the same amino acid replacement rate matrix lead
	to the same grouping; but different rate matrices lead to different
	groupings. Therefore it can be used as an automated method to compare
	matrices derived from consideration of different types of proteins,
	or from parts of proteins sharing different structural or functional
	features. We present the groupings resulting from two standard matrices

  abstract = {Reconstruction of ancestral DNA and amino acid sequences is an important
	means of inferring information about past evolutionary events. Such
	reconstructions suggest changes in molecular function and evolutionary
	processes over the course of evolution and are used to infer adaptation
	and convergence. Maximum likelihood (ML) is generally thought to
	provide relatively accurate reconstructed sequences compared to parsimony,
	but both methods lead to the inference of multiple directional changes
	in nucleotide frequencies in primate mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). To
	better understand this surprising result, as well as to better understand
	how parsimony and ML differ, we constructed a series of computationally
	simple "conditional pathway" methods that differed in the number
	of substitutions allowed per site along each branch, and we also
	evaluated the entire Bayesian posterior frequency distribution of
	reconstructed ancestral states. We analyzed primate mitochondrial
	cytochrome b (Cyt-b) and cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes
	and found that ML reconstructs ancestral frequencies that are often
	more different from tip sequences than are parsimony reconstructions.
	In contrast, frequency reconstructions based on the posterior ensemble
	more closely resemble extant nucleotide frequencies. Simulations
	indicate that these differences in ancestral sequence inference are
	probably due to deterministic bias caused by high uncertainty in
	the optimization-based ancestral reconstruction methods (parsimony,
	ML, Bayesian maximum a posteriori). In contrast, ancestral nucleotide
	frequencies based on an average of the Bayesian set of credible ancestral
	sequences are much less biased. The methods involving simpler conditional
	pathway calculations have slightly reduced likelihood values compared
	to full likelihood calculations, but they can provide fairly unbiased
	nucleotide reconstructions and may be useful in more complex phylogenetic
	analyses than considered here due to their speed and flexibility.
	To determine whether biased reconstructions using optimization methods
	might affect inferences of functional properties, ancestral primate
	mitochondrial tRNA sequences were inferred and helix-forming propensities
	for conserved pairs were evaluated in silico. For ambiguously reconstructed
	nucleotides at sites with high base composition variability, ancestral
	tRNA sequences from Bayesian analyses were more compatible with canonical
	base pairing than were those inferred by other methods. Thus, nucleotide
	bias in reconstructed sequences apparently can lead to serious bias

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Viridiplantae comprise two major phyla: the Streptophyta,
	containing the charophycean green algae and all land plants, and
	the Chlorophyta, containing the remaining green algae. Despite recent
	progress in unravelling phylogenetic relationships among major green
	plant lineages, problematic nodes still remain in the green tree
	of life. One of the major issues concerns the scaly biflagellate
	Mesostigma viride, which is either regarded as representing the earliest
	divergence of the Streptophyta or a separate lineage that diverged
	before the Chlorophyta and Streptophyta. Phylogenies based on chloroplast
	and mitochondrial genomes support the latter view. Because some green
	plant lineages are not represented in these phylogenies, sparse taxon
	sampling has been suspected to yield misleading topologies. Here,
	we describe the complete chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence of the
	early-diverging charophycean alga Chlorokybus atmophyticus and present
	chloroplast genome-based phylogenies with an expanded taxon sampling.
	RESULTS: The 152,254 bp Chlorokybus cpDNA closely resembles its Mesostigma
	homologue at the gene content and gene order levels. Using various
	methods of phylogenetic inference, we analyzed amino acid and nucleotide
	data sets that were derived from 45 protein-coding genes common to
	the cpDNAs of 37 green algal/land plant taxa and eight non-green
	algae. Unexpectedly, all best trees recovered a robust clade uniting
	Chlorokybus and Mesostigma. In protein trees, this clade was sister
	to all streptophytes and chlorophytes and this placement received
	moderate support. In contrast, gene trees provided unequivocal support
	to the notion that the Mesostigma + Chlorokybus clade represents
	the earliest-diverging branch of the Streptophyta. Independent analyses
	of structural data (gene content and/or gene order) and of subsets
	of amino acid data progressively enriched in slow-evolving sites
	led us to conclude that the latter topology reflects the true organismal
	relationships. CONCLUSION: In disclosing a sister relationship between
	the Mesostigmatales and Chlorokybales, our study resolves the long-standing
	debate about the nature of the unicellular flagellated ancestors
	of land plants and alters significantly our concepts regarding the
	evolution of streptophyte algae. Moreover, in predicting a richer
	chloroplast gene repertoire than previously inferred for the common
	ancestor of all streptophytes, our study has contributed to a better
	understanding of chloroplast genome evolution in the Viridiplantae.},

  abstract = {Phylogeny reconstruction is a difficult computational problem, because
	the number of possible solutions increases with the number of included
	taxa. For example, for only 14 taxa, there are more than seven trillion
	possible unrooted phylogenetic trees. For this reason, phylogenetic
	inference methods commonly use clustering algorithms (e.g., the neighbor-joining
	method) or heuristic search strategies to minimize the amount of
	time spent evaluating nonoptimal trees. Even heuristic searches can
	be painfully slow, especially when computationally intensive optimality
	criteria such as maximum likelihood are used. I describe here a different
	approach to heuristic searching (using a genetic algorithm) that
	can tremendously reduce the time required for maximum-likelihood
	phylogenetic inference, especially for data sets involving large
	numbers of taxa. Genetic algorithms are simulations of natural selection
	in which individuals are encoded solutions to the problem of interest.
	Here, labeled phylogenetic trees are the individuals, and differential
	reproduction is effected by allowing the number of offspring produced
	by each individual to be proportional to that individual's rank likelihood
	score. Natural selection increases the average likelihood in the
	evolving population of phylogenetic trees, and the genetic algorithm
	is allowed to proceed until the likelihood of the best individual
	ceases to improve over time. An example is presented involving rbcL
	sequence data for 55 taxa of green plants. The genetic algorithm
	described here required only 6\% of the computational effort required
	by a conventional heuristic search using tree bisection/reconnection
	(TBR) branch swapping to obtain the same maximum-likelihood topology.},

	The assumption of rate constancy has often been taken as a basis
	for reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships among organisms
	or genes and for dating evolutionary events. Further, it has been
	taken as strong support for the neutral mutation hypothesis, which
	postulates that the majority of molecular changes in evolution are
	due to neutral or nearly neutral mutations. For these reasons, the
	validity of the rate constancy assumption is a vital issue in molecular
	evolution. Recent studies using DNA sequence data have raised serious
	doubts about the hypothesis. These studies provided support for the
	suggestion made from immunological distance and protein sequence
	data that a rate slowdown has occurred in hominoid evolution, and
	showed, in agreement with DNA hybridization studies, that rates of
	nucleotide substitution are significantly higher in rodents than
	in man. Here, rates of nucleotide substitution in rodents are estimated
	to be 4-10 times higher than those in higher primates and 2-4 times
	higher than those in artiodactyls. Further, this study provides strong
	evidence for the hominoid slowdown hypothesis and suggests a further
	rate-slowdown in hominoid evolution. Our results suggest that the
	variation in rate among mammals is primarily due to differences in
	generation time rather than changes in DNA repair mechanisms. We
	also propose a method for estimating the divergence times between
	species when the rate constancy assumption is violated.},

  year = {2005},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {83},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two central problems in computational biology are the
	determination of the alignment and phylogeny of a set of biological
	sequences. The traditional approach to this problem is to first build
	a multiple alignment of these sequences, followed by a phylogenetic
	reconstruction step based on this multiple alignment. However, alignment
	and phylogenetic inference are fundamentally interdependent, and
	ignoring this fact leads to biased and overconfident estimations.
	Whether the main interest be in sequence alignment or phylogeny,
	a major goal of computational biology is the co-estimation of both.
	RESULTS: We developed a fully Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method
	for coestimating phylogeny and sequence alignment, under the Thorne-Kishino-Felsenstein
	model of substitution and single nucleotide insertion-deletion (indel)
	events. In our earlier work, we introduced a novel and efficient
	algorithm, termed the "indel peeling algorithm", which includes indels
	as phylogenetically informative evolutionary events, and resembles
	Felsenstein's peeling algorithm for substitutions on a phylogenetic
	tree. For a fixed alignment, our extension analytically integrates
	out both substitution and indel events within a proper statistical
	model, without the need for data augmentation at internal tree nodes,
	allowing for efficient sampling of tree topologies and edge lengths.
	To additionally sample multiple alignments, we here introduce an
	efficient partial Metropolized independence sampler for alignments,
	and combine these two algorithms into a fully Bayesian co-estimation
	procedure for the alignment and phylogeny problem. Our approach results
	in estimates for the posterior distribution of evolutionary rate
	parameters, for the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) phylogenetic tree,
	and for the posterior decoding alignment. Estimates for the evolutionary
	tree and multiple alignment are augmented with confidence estimates
	for each node height and alignment column. Our results indicate that
	the patterns in reliability broadly correspond to structural features
	of the proteins, and thus provides biologically meaningful information
	which is not existent in the usual point-estimate of the alignment.
	Our methods can handle input data of moderate size (10-20 protein
	sequences, each 100-200 bp), which we analyzed overnight on a standard
	2 GHz personal computer. CONCLUSION: Joint analysis of multiple sequence
	alignment, evolutionary trees and additional evolutionary parameters
	can be now done within a single coherent statistical framework.},

  abstract = {Several studies have found evidence for more positive selection on
	the chimpanzee lineage compared with the human lineage since the
	two species split. A potential concern, however, is that these findings
	may simply reflect artifacts of the data: inaccuracies in the underlying
	chimpanzee genome sequence, which is of lower quality than human.
	To test this hypothesis, we generated de novo genome assemblies of
	chimpanzee and macaque and aligned them with human. We also implemented
	a novel bioinformatic procedure for producing alignments of closely
	related species that uses synteny information to remove misassembled
	and misaligned regions, and sequence quality scores to remove nucleotides
	that are less reliable. We applied this procedure to re-examine 59
	genes recently identified as candidates for positive selection in
	chimpanzees. The great majority of these signals disappear after
	application of our new bioinformatic procedure. We also carried out
	laboratory-based resequencing of 10 of the regions in multiple chimpanzees
	and humans, and found that our alignments were correct wherever there
	was a conflict with the published results. These findings throw into
	question previous findings that there has been more positive selection
	in chimpanzees than in humans since the two species diverged. Our
	study also highlights the challenges of searching the extreme tails
	of distributions for signals of natural selection. Inaccuracies in
	the genome sequence at even a tiny fraction of genes can produce
	false-positive signals, which make it difficult to identify loci
	that have genuinely been targets of selection.},

  abstract = {A new method is developed for calculating sequence substitution probabilities
	using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The basic strategy
	is to use uniformization to transform the original continuous time
	Markov process into a Poisson substitution process and a discrete
	Markov chain of state transitions. An efficient MCMC algorithm for
	evaluating substitution probabilities by this approach using a continuous
	gamma distribution to model site-specific rates is outlined. The
	method is applied to the problem of inferring branch lengths and
	site-specific rates from nucleotide sequences under a general time-reversible
	(GTR) model and a computer program BYPASSR is developed. Simulations
	are used to examine the performance of the new program relative to
	an existing program BASEML that uses a discrete approximation for
	the gamma distributed prior on site-specific rates. It is found that
	BASEML and BYPASSR are in close agreement when inferring branch lengths,
	regardless of the number of rate categories used, but that BASEML
	tends to underestimate high site-specific substitution rates, and
	to overestimate intermediate rates, when fewer than 50 rate categories
	are used. Rate estimates obtained using BASEML agree more closely
	with those of BYPASSR as the number of rate categories increases.
	Analyses of the posterior distributions of site-specific rates from
	BYPASSR suggest that a large number of taxa are needed to obtain
	precise estimates of site-specific rates, especially when rates are
	very high or very low. The method is applied to analyze 45 sequences
	of the alpha 2B adrenergic receptor gene (A2AB) from a sample of
	eutherian taxa. In general, the pattern expected for regions under
	negative selection is observed with third codon positions having
	the highest inferred rates, followed by first codon positions and
	with second codon positions having the lowest inferred rates. Several
	sites show exceptionally high substitution rates at second codon
	positions that may represent the effects of positive selection.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach at the atomic level for the development
	of knowledge-based mean force potentials (MFPs) that can be used
	in fold recognition, ab initio structure prediction, comparative
	modelling and molecular recognition. Our method is based on atom-type
	definitions, raising the total frequency of the pairwise distributions
	and leading to very accurate and specific distance-dependent energy
	functions. Forty different heavy atom types were defined depending
	on their bond connectivity, chemical nature and location level (side-chain
	or backbone). Using this approach it has been possible to obtain
	average frequencies of pairwise contacts about 15 times higher than
	the ones obtained using the classic way of one heavy atom definition
	for each amino acid (i.e. alpha-carbon, beta-carbon, virtual centroid
	or virtual beta-carbon co-ordinates). In this paper we use this approach
	to develop a MFP that can be used in fold recognition and we compare
	it with a classic MFP at the amino acid level compiled from the alpha-carbon
	distances between the different amino acid pairs. Both potentials
	involve all the pairwise contacts extracted from a non-redundant
	folds database of 180 protein chains with a sequence identity threshold
	of 25\%. The pairwise energy functions of the MFP at the atomic level
	have a deep and very well defined minimum for each pairwise interaction,
	in contrast to the same curves obtained from the MFP developed at
	the amino acid level, which generally have multiple minima with similar
	depth. Our results also show that this MFP is able to produce very
	similar energy profiles for couples of proteins that share a very
	low sequence identity but are closely related at the structural level.
	When these profiles are plotted considering the structure-structure
	alignment, they are mostly superimposed, showing a correlation with
	the structure-structure similarity. In the same test, the MFP at
	the amino acid level fails to produce similar profiles. We suggest
	that using this MFP at the atomic level in the last stages of fold
	recognition or threading, when some candidates are available, can
	improve the sequence-structure alignments and, therefore, the final
	models. We also discuss the possibility of using this approach in

  abstract = {A protein structure model generally needs to be evaluated to assess
	whether or not it has the correct fold. To improve fold assessment,
	four types of a residue-level statistical potential were optimized,
	including distance-dependent, contact, Phi/Psi dihedral angle, and
	accessible surface statistical potentials. Approximately 10,000 test
	models with the correct and incorrect folds were built by automated
	comparative modeling of protein sequences of known structure. The
	criterion used to discriminate between the correct and incorrect
	models was the Z-score of the model energy. The performance of a
	Z-score was determined as a function of many variables in the derivation
	and use of the corresponding statistical potential. The performance
	was measured by the fractions of the correctly and incorrectly assessed
	test models. The most discriminating combination of any one of the
	four tested potentials is the sum of the normalized distance-dependent
	and accessible surface potentials. The distance-dependent potential
	that is optimal for assessing models of all sizes uses both C(alpha)
	and C(beta) atoms as interaction centers, distinguishes between all
	20 standard residue types, has the distance range of 30 A, and is
	derived and used by taking into account the sequence separation of
	the interacting atom pairs. The terms for the sequentially local
	interactions are significantly less informative than those for the
	sequentially nonlocal interactions. The accessible surface potential
	that is optimal for assessing models of all sizes uses C(beta) atoms
	as interaction centers and distinguishes between all 20 standard
	residue types. The performance of the tested statistical potentials
	is not likely to improve significantly with an increase in the number
	of known protein structures used in their derivation. The parameters
	of fold assessment whose optimal values vary significantly with model
	size include the size of the known protein structures used to derive
	the potential and the distance range of the accessible surface potential.
	Fold assessment by statistical potentials is most difficult for the
	very small models. This difficulty presents a challenge to fold assessment
	in large-scale comparative modeling, which produces many small and
	incomplete models. The results described in this study provide a
	basis for an optimal use of statistical potentials in fold assessment.},

	Eighteen processed pseudogenes were sequenced, including 12 on autosomes

	order of magnitude higher than mutation rates at other sites. Single
	nucleotide substitutions are 10 times more frequent than length mutations.
	Comparison of rates of evolution for X-linked and autosomal pseudogenes
	suggests that the male mutation rate is 4 times the female mutation

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Supertree methods combine trees on subsets of
	the full taxon set together to produce a tree on the entire set of
	taxa. Of the many supertree methods, the most popular is MRP (Matrix
	Representation with Parsimony), a method that operates by first encoding
	the input set of source trees by a large matrix (the "MRP matrix")
	over {0,1,?}, and then running maximum parsimony heuristics on the
	MRP matrix. Experimental studies evaluating MRP in comparison to
	other supertree methods have established that for large datasets,
	MRP generally produces trees of equal or greater accuracy than other
	methods, and can run on larger datasets. A recent development in
	supertree methods is SuperFine+MRP, a method that combines MRP with
	a divide-and-conquer approach, and produces more accurate trees in
	less time than MRP. In this paper we consider a new approach for
	supertree estimation, called MRL (Matrix Representation with Likelihood).
	MRL begins with the same MRP matrix, but then analyzes the MRP matrix
	using heuristics (such as RAxML) for 2-state Maximum Likelihood.
	RESULTS: We compared MRP and SuperFine+MRP with MRL and SuperFine+MRL
	on simulated and biological datasets. We examined the MRP and MRL
	scores of each method on a wide range of datasets, as well as the
	resulting topological accuracy of the trees. Our experimental results
	show that MRL, coupled with a very good ML heuristic such as RAxML,
	produced more accurate trees than MRP, and MRL scores were more strongly
	correlated with topological accuracy than MRP scores. CONCLUSIONS:
	SuperFine+MRP when based upon a good MRP heuristic such as TNT, produces
	among the best scores for both MRP and MRL, and is generally faster
	and more topologically accurate than other supertree methods we tested.},

	first estimate the distribution of selection coefficients from two
	large viral data sets under the assumption that the viral population
	size is the same along all lineages of the phylogeny and that the
	selection coefficients vary among sites. We then implement several
	new models in which the lineages of the phylogeny may have different
	population sizes. We apply the new models to a data set consisting
	of the coding regions from eight primate mitochondrial genomes. The
	results suggest that there might be little power to determine the
	exact shape of the distribution of selection coefficient but that
	the normal and gamma distributions fit the data significantly better
	than the exponential distribution.},

	substitutions in mammalian star phylogenies (rodentia, artiodactyla,

	of the nearly neutral theory, with some notable exceptions. The nearly
	neutral theory also predicts that the variance of the evolutionary

	inference because they explicitly assume evolutionary independence
	between short nucleotide tuples. In our model we address this by
	replacing context dependencies within codons by annotation-specific
	heterogeneity in the substitution process. Through a general procedure,
	we fragment the alignment into sets of short nucleotide tuples based
	on both the protein coding and the structural annotation. These individual
	tuples are assumed to evolve independently, and the different tuple
	sets are assigned different annotation-specific substitution models
	shared between their members. This allows us to build a composite
	model of the substitution process from components of traditional
	phylogenetic models. We applied this to a data set of full-genome
	sequences from the hepatitis C virus where five RNA structures are
	mapped within the coding region. This allowed us to partition the
	effects of selection on different structural elements and to test
	various hypotheses concerning the relation of these effects. Of particular
	interest, we found evidence of a functional role of loop and bulge
	regions, as these were shown to evolve according to a different and
	more constrained selective regime than the nonpairing regions outside
	the RNA structures. Other potential applications of the model include
	comparative RNA structure prediction in coding regions and RNA virus
	phylogenetics.},

	(MHC) class I molecules by T lymphocytes is an essential part of
	immune surveillance. Each MHC allele has a characteristic peptide
	binding preference, which can be captured in prediction algorithms,

	likely to bind MHC. Here we make public a large set of 48,828 quantitative
	peptide-binding affinity measurements relating to 48 different mouse,
	human, macaque, and chimpanzee MHC class I alleles. We use this data
	to establish a set of benchmark predictions with one neural network
	method and two matrix-based prediction methods extensively utilized
	in our groups. In general, the neural network outperforms the matrix-based
	predictions mainly due to its ability to generalize even on a small
	amount of data. We also retrieved predictions from tools publicly
	available on the internet. While differences in the data used to
	generate these predictions hamper direct comparisons, we do conclude
	that tools based on combinatorial peptide libraries perform remarkably
	well. The transparent prediction evaluation on this dataset provides
	tool developers with a benchmark for comparison of newly developed
	prediction methods. In addition, to generate and evaluate our own
	prediction methods, we have established an easily extensible web-based
	prediction framework that allows automated side-by-side comparisons
	of prediction methods implemented by experts. This is an advance
	over the current practice of tool developers having to generate reference
	predictions themselves, which can lead to underestimating the performance
	of prediction methods they are not as familiar with as their own.
	The overall goal of this effort is to provide a transparent prediction
	evaluation allowing bioinformaticians to identify promising features
	of prediction methods and providing guidance to immunologists regarding

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phylogenies of rapidly evolving pathogens can be difficult
	to resolve because of the small number of substitutions that accumulate
	in the short times since divergence. To improve resolution of such
	phylogenies we propose using insertion and deletion (indel) information
	in addition to substitution information. We accomplish this through
	joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny in a Bayesian framework,
	drawing inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Joint estimation
	of alignment and phylogeny sidesteps biases that stem from conditioning
	on a single alignment by taking into account the ensemble of near-optimal
	alignments. RESULTS: We introduce a novel Markov chain transition
	kernel that improves computational efficiency by proposing non-local
	topology rearrangements and by block sampling alignment and topology
	parameters. In addition, we extend our previous indel model to increase
	biological realism by placing indels preferentially on longer branches.
	We demonstrate the ability of indel information to increase phylogenetic
	resolution in examples drawn from within-host viral sequence samples.
	We also demonstrate the importance of taking alignment uncertainty
	into account when using such information. Finally, we show that codon-based
	substitution models can significantly affect alignment quality and
	phylogenetic inference by unrealistically forcing indels to begin
	and end between codons. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that indel
	information can improve phylogenetic resolution of recently diverged
	pathogens and that alignment uncertainty should be considered in
	such analyses.},

	Furthermore, because the alignment and phylogeny are constructed
	simultaneously, a guide tree is not needed. This sidesteps the problem
	in which alignments created by progressive alignment are biased toward
	the guide tree used to generate them. Joint estimation also allows
	us to model rate variation between sites when estimating the alignment

	group sister taxa in the phylogeny. Our indel model makes use of
	affine gap penalties and considers indels of multiple letters. We
	make the simplifying assumption that the indel process is identical

	of branch length. We use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method

	By allowing a relatively general dependence structure among sites,

	To quantify the impact of protein structure on protein evolution,

	structure, this approach can lead to refined detection and characterization

	Analyses of lysozyme c and annexin V sequence pairs yield the biologically
	reasonable result that amino acid replacement rates are higher when
	the replacements lead to energetically favorable proteins than when
	they destabilize the proteins. Although the focus here is evolutionary
	dependence among codons that is associated with protein structure,

	acid positions of a protein. As of yet, such models have focused
	on site interdependencies resulting from sequence-structure compatibility
	constraints, using simplified structural representations in combination
	with a set of statistical potentials. This structural compatibility
	criterion is meant as a proxy for sequence fitness, and the methods
	developed thus far can incorporate different site-interdependent
	fitness proxies based on other measurements. However, no methods

	outstanding problems in evolutionary biology. The sequencing and
	phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes led to the first
	nearly comprehensive phylogenies of eukaryotes in the late 1980s,
	and supported a view where cellular complexity was acquired during
	the divergence of extant unicellular eukaryote lineages. More recently,
	however, refinements in analytical methods coupled with the availability
	of many additional genes for phylogenetic analysis showed that much
	of the deep structure of early rRNA trees was artefactual. Recent
	phylogenetic analyses of a multiple genes and the discovery of important
	molecular and ultrastructural phylogenetic characters have resolved
	eukaryotic diversity into six major hypothetical groups. Yet relationships
	among these groups remain poorly understood because of saturation
	of sequence changes on the billion-year time-scale, possible rapid
	radiations of major lineages, phylogenetic artefacts and endosymbiotic
	or lateral gene transfer among eukaryotes. Estimating the divergence
	dates between the major eukaryote lineages using molecular analyses
	is even more difficult than phylogenetic estimation. Error in such
	analyses comes from a myriad of sources including: (i) calibration
	fossil dates, (ii) the assumed phylogenetic tree, (iii) the nucleotide
	or amino acid substitution model, (iv) substitution number (branch
	length) estimates, (v) the model of how rates of evolution change
	over the tree, (vi) error inherent in the time estimates for a given
	model and (vii) how multiple gene data are treated. By reanalysing
	datasets from recently published molecular clock studies, we show
	that when errors from these various sources are properly accounted
	for, the confidence intervals on inferred dates can be very large.
	Furthermore, estimated dates of divergence vary hugely depending
	on the methods used and their assumptions. Accurate dating of divergence
	times among the major eukaryote lineages will require a robust tree
	of eukaryotes, a much richer Proterozoic fossil record of microbial
	eukaryotes assignable to extant groups for calibration, more sophisticated

	of substitution rates in the stem regions seems to be higher than
	in the loop regions of animal 16S-like rRNAs due to presence of a
	few rapidly evolving sites. The model appears to be helpful in understanding
	the regularities of nucleotide substitution in rRNAs and probably
	minimizing errors in recovering phylogeny for distantly related taxa

	The predictions are therefore highly sensitive to alignment errors

	methods provide a framework for performing phylogenetic analyses
	by examining a distribution of alignments. RESULTS: We developed
	a novel algorithm for predicting functional elements by combining
	statistical alignment and phylogenetic footprinting (SAPF). SAPF
	simultaneously performs both alignment and annotation by combining
	phylogenetic footprinting techniques with an hidden Markov model
	(HMM) transducer-based multiple alignment model, and can analyze
	sequence data from multiple sequences. We assessed SAPF's predictive
	performance on two simulated datasets and three well-annotated cis-regulatory
	modules from newly sequenced Drosophila genomes. The results demonstrate
	that removing the traditional dependence on a single alignment can
	significantly augment the predictive performance, especially when
	there is uncertainty in the alignment of functional regions. AVAILABILITY:

	the concatenated sequence came from different genes. Here, we discuss
	two criteria for inferring the optimal tree topology from data sets
	with multiple genes. These criteria are designed for multigene data
	sets where gene-specific evolutionary features are too important
	to ignore. One criterion is conventional and is obtained by taking
	the sum of log-likelihoods over all genes. The other criterion is
	obtained by dividing the log-likelihood for a gene by its sequence
	length and then taking the arithmetic mean over genes of these ratios.
	A similar strategy could be adopted with parsimony scores. The optimal
	tree is then declared to be the one for which the sum or the arithmetic
	mean is maximized. These criteria are justified within a two-stage
	hierarchical framework. The first level of the hierarchy represents
	gene-specific evolutionary features, and the second represents site-specific
	features for given genes. For testing significance of the optimal
	topology, we suggest a two-stage bootstrap procedure that involves
	resampling genes and then resampling alignment columns within resampled
	genes. An advantage of this procedure over concatenation is that
	it can effectively account for gene-specific evolutionary features.

  abstract = {Nucleotide substitution in both coding and noncoding regions is context-dependent,
	in the sense that substitution rates depend on the identity of neighboring
	bases. Context-dependent substitution has been modeled in the case
	of two sequences and an unrooted phylogenetic tree, but it has only
	been accommodated in limited ways with more general phylogenies.
	In this article, extensions are presented to standard phylogenetic
	models that allow for better handling of context-dependent substitution,
	yet still permit exact inference at reasonable computational cost.
	The new models improve goodness of fit substantially for both coding
	and noncoding data. Considering context dependence leads to much
	larger improvements than does using a richer substitution model or
	allowing for rate variation across sites, under the assumption of
	site independence. The observed improvements appear to derive from
	three separate properties of the models: their explicit characterization
	of context-dependent substitution within N-tuples of adjacent sites,
	their ability to accommodate overlapping N-tuples, and their rich
	parameterization of the substitution process. Parameter estimation
	is accomplished using an expectation maximization algorithm, with
	a quasi-Newton algorithm for the maximization step; this approach
	is shown to be preferable to ordinary Newton methods for parameter-rich
	models. Overlapping tuples are efficiently handled by assuming Markov
	dependence of the observed bases at each site on those at the N -
	1 preceding sites, and the required conditional probabilities are
	computed with an extension of Felsenstein's algorithm. Estimated
	substitution rates based on a data set of about 160,000 noncoding
	sites in mammalian genomes indicate a pronounced CpG effect, but
	they also suggest a complex overall pattern of context-dependent
	substitution, comprising a variety of subtle effects. Estimates based
	on about 3 million sites in coding regions demonstrate that amino
	acid substitution rates can be learned at the nucleotide level, and
	suggest that context effects across codon boundaries are significant.},

  abstract = {Empirical models of substitution are often used in protein sequence
	analysis because the large alphabet of amino acids requires that
	many parameters be estimated in all but the simplest parametric models.
	When information about structure is used in the analysis of substitutions
	in structured RNA, a similar situation occurs. The number of parameters
	necessary to adequately describe the substitution process increases
	in order to model the substitution of paired bases. We have developed
	a method to obtain substitution rate matrices empirically from RNA
	alignments that include structural information in the form of base
	pairs. Our data consisted of alignments from the European Ribosomal
	RNA Database of Bacterial and Eukaryotic Small Subunit and Large
	Subunit Ribosomal RNA ( Wuyts et al. 2001. Nucleic Acids Res. 29:175-177;
	Wuyts et al. 2002. Nucleic Acids Res. 30:183-185). Using secondary
	structural information, we converted each sequence in the alignments
	into a sequence over a 20-symbol code: one symbol for each of the
	four individual bases, and one symbol for each of the 16 ordered
	pairs. Substitutions in the coded sequences are defined in the natural
	way, as observed changes between two sequences at any particular
	site. For given ranges (windows) of sequence divergence, we obtained
	substitution frequency matrices for the coded sequences. Using a
	technique originally developed for modeling amino acid substitutions
	( Veerassamy, Smith, and Tillier. 2003. J. Comput. Biol. 10:997-1010),
	we were able to estimate the actual evolutionary distance for each
	window. The actual evolutionary distances were used to derive instantaneous
	rate matrices, and from these we selected a universal rate matrix.
	The universal rate matrices were incorporated into the Phylip Software
	package ( Felsenstein 2002. http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html),
	and we analyzed the ribosomal RNA alignments using both distance
	and maximum likelihood methods. The empirical substitution models
	performed well on simulated data, and produced reasonable evolutionary
	trees for 16S ribosomal RNA sequences from sequenced Bacterial genomes.
	Empirical models have the advantage of being easily implemented,
	and the fact that the code consists of 20 symbols makes the models
	easily incorporated into existing programs for protein sequence analysis.
	In addition, the models are useful for simulating the evolution of
	RNA sequence and structure simultaneously.},

	enormous computational challenges, and current computational methods

	was analyzed in detail. It is well known that the rate of nucleotide
	substitution for the control region is much higher than that for
	any other part of mtDNA. In this study, the higher substitution rate
	was attributed to the higher rate of transition-type substitution
	between pyrimidines within the D-loop part, whereas the rates of
	other types of substitution were essentially the same over the entire
	mtDNA molecule. Even within the control region, the rate and pattern
	of nucleotide substitution were different between the D-loop part
	and the rest. The rate and pattern for the non-D-loop part were very
	similar to those for fourfold-degenerate sites in the protein-coding
	region. In contrast, the D-loop and non-D-loop parts showed similarities
	in the base composition, whereas the base composition of fourfold-degenerate
	sites slightly different from that of the both parts of the control
	region. It is concluded, therefore, that the nucleotide frequencies
	of the control region should be used to estimate the number of substitutions
	(d) between the control region sequences. However, a method to verify
	the accuracy of the estimation of d by means of the transition/transversion
	(s/v) ratio was theoretically studied. It was suggested that the
	s/v ratio becomes constant over a wide range of d values only when
	the estimation of d is unbiased. On the basis of this result, the

	has not been suitably effective in isolating the fastest evolving

	Let Ki denote the Ka value of each class (i = 1, ..., 75 from the

	classes, denoted Kh (for high-exchangeability types), has two important
	properties: (1) Kh usually accounts for 25\%-30\% of total amino
	acid changes and (2) when the observed number of amino acid substitutions
	is large, Kh is predictably twice the value of Ka. This shall be
	referred to as the twofold approximation. The new method for estimating
	Kh is applied to the comparisons between human and macaque and between
	mouse and rat. The twofold approximation holds well in these data

	Two criteria are used to detect significantly cosubstituting sites.
	One criterion corresponds to that of Shindyalov, Kolchanov, and Sander.
	The second one is based on intensive simulations of evolution of
	protein sequences along a phylogeny to estimate the significance
	of the number of observed cosubstitutions for pairs of sites. Our
	results show an important sensitivity of the detection of cosubstituting
	sites to the model used for the phylogenetic reconstruction. Not
	considering the uncertainty associated with the reconstructed data
	might lead to detecting numerous false-positive pairs of sites. Finally,
	significant amounts of coevolving pairs could be found only when
	substitutions affecting the physicochemical properties of the amino
	acids were considered. Such results suggest evidence of a cosubstitution
	mechanism in protein evolution. However, the identification of nonambiguous

	Recent work suggests that analysis of large data sets of evolutionary
	rates in conjunction with the results from high-throughput functional
	genomic experiments can identify the factors that cause proteins
	to evolve at such dramatically different rates. To this end, we estimated
	the evolutionary rates of >3,000 proteins in four species of the
	yeast genus Saccharomyces and investigated their relationship with
	levels of expression and protein dispensability. Each protein's dispensability
	was estimated by the growth rate of mutants deficient for the protein.
	Our analyses of these improved evolutionary and functional genomic
	data sets yield three main results. First, dispensability and expression
	have independent, significant effects on the rate of protein evolution.
	Second, measurements of expression levels in the laboratory can be
	used to filter data sets of dispensability estimates, removing variates
	that are unlikely to reflect real biological effects. Third, structural
	equation models show that although we may reasonably infer that dispensability
	and expression have significant effects on protein evolutionary rate,
	we cannot yet accurately estimate the relative strengths of these
	effects.},

	Applied to protein-coding DNA, the SDT model allows doublet and triplet

	We have implemented the SDT model for maximum-likelihood phylogenetic

	on its surrounding negative supercoiling. Here, we demonstrate that
	the d(CG)9 repeat sequence stimulates gene activity by forming a
	Z-DNA secondary structure. Furthermore, the extent of transcriptional
	enhancement by Z-DNA is promoter-specific and determined by its separation
	distance relative to the TATA box. The stimulatory effect exerted
	by promoter proximal Z-DNA is not affected by helical phasing relative
	to the TATA box, suggesting that Z-DNA effects transcription without
	interacting with the general transcription machinery by looping-out
	the intervening DNA. A nucleosome-scanning assay reveals that the
	d(CG)9 repeat sequence in the Z conformation blocks nucleosome formation,
	and it is found in the linker DNA with two flanking nucleosomes.
	This result suggests that Z-DNA formation proximally upstream of

	A lineage that underwent Darwinian selection may have a nonsynonymous/synonymous
	rate ratio (dN/dS) that is different from those of other lineages
	or greater than one. In this paper, several codon-based likelihood
	models that allow for variable dN/dS ratios among lineages were developed.
	They were then used to construct likelihood ratio tests to examine
	whether the dN/dS ratio is variable among evolutionary lineages,
	whether the ratio for a few lineages of interest is different from
	the background ratio for other lineages in the phylogeny, and whether
	the dN/dS ratio for the lineages of interest is greater than one.
	The tests were applied to the lysozyme genes of 24 primate species.
	The dN/dS ratios were found to differ significantly among lineages,
	indicating that the evolution of primate lysozymes is episodic, which
	is incompatible with the neutral theory. Maximum-likelihood estimates
	of parameters suggested that about nine nonsynonymous and zero synonymous
	nucleotide substitutions occurred in the lineage leading to hominoids,
	and the dN/dS ratio for that lineage is significantly greater than
	one. The corresponding estimates for the lineage ancestral to colobine
	monkeys were nine and one, and the dN/dS ratio for the lineage is

	higher than the background ratio. The likelihood analysis thus confirmed

	assumptions concerning the process of sequence evolution, such as
	constancy of substitution rates between nucleotides, constancy of
	rates across nucleotide sites, and equal branch lengths in the tree.
	For practical data analysis, the requirement of equal branch lengths
	means similar substitution rates among lineages (the existence of
	an approximate molecular clock), relatively long interior branches,
	and also few species in the data. However, a small amount of evolution
	is neither a necessary nor a sufficient requirement of the method.
	The difficulties involved in the application of current statistical
	estimation theory to tree reconstruction were discussed, and it was
	suggested that the approach proposed by Felsenstein (1981, J. Mol.
	Evol. 17: 368-376) for topology estimation, as well as its many variations
	and extensions, differs fundamentally from the maximum likelihood
	estimation of a conventional statistical parameter. Evidence was
	presented showing that the Felsenstein approach does not share the
	asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood estimator of a statistical
	parameter. Computer simulations were performed to study the probability
	that MP recovers the true tree under a hierarchy of models of nucleotide
	substitution; its performance relative to the likelihood method was
	especially noted. The results appeared to support the intuitive examination
	of the assumptions underlying MP. When a simple model of nucleotide
	substitution was assumed to generate data, the probability that MP
	recovers the true topology could be as high as, or even higher than,
	that for the likelihood method. When the assumed model became more
	complex and realistic, e.g., when substitution rates were allowed
	to differ between nucleotides or across sites, the probability that
	MP recovers the true topology, and especially its performance relative
	to that of the likelihood method, generally deteriorates. As the
	complexity of the process of nucleotide substitution in real sequences
	is well recognized, the likelihood method appears preferable to parsimony.

	nucleotides is a continuous-time Markov process, with the four nucleotides
	as the states. The spatial process used to describe variation and
	dependence of substitution rates over sites is based on a serially
	correlated gamma distribution, i.e., an auto-gamma model assuming
	Markov-dependence of rates at adjacent sites. To achieve computational
	efficiency, we use several equal-probability categories to approximate
	the gamma distribution, and the result is an auto-discrete-gamma
	model for rates over sites. Correlation of rates at sites then is
	modeled by the Markov chain transition of rates at adjacent sites
	from one rate category to another, the states of the chain being
	the rate categories. Two versions of nonparametric models, which
	place no restrictions on the distributional forms of rates for sites,

	evolution, purifying selection, and positive selection, respectively.
	Previous studies that used this measure to detect positive selection
	have often taken an approach of pairwise comparison, estimating substitution
	rates by averaging over all sites in the protein. As most amino acids
	in a functional protein are under structural and functional constraints
	and adaptive evolution probably affects only a few sites at a few

	time has little power. Previously, we developed codon-based substitution

	among sites. In this paper we extend previous models to allow the
	omega ratio to vary both among sites and among lineages and implement
	the new models in the likelihood framework. These models may be useful
	for identifying positive selection along prespecified lineages that
	affects only a few sites in the protein. We apply those branch-site
	models as well as previous branch- and site-specific models to three
	data sets: the lysozyme genes from primates, the tumor suppressor
	BRCA1 genes from primates, and the phytochrome (PHY) gene family
	in angiosperms. Positive selection is detected in the lysozyme and

  abstract = {The role of somatic mutation in cancer is well established and several
	genes have been identified that are frequent targets. This has enabled
	large-scale screening studies of the spectrum of somatic mutations
	in cancers of particular organs. Cancer gene mutation databases compile
	the results of many studies and can provide insight into the importance
	of specific amino acid sequences and functional domains in cancer,
	as well as elucidate aspects of the mutation process. Past studies
	of the spectrum of cancer mutations (in particular genes) have examined
	overall frequencies of mutation (at specific nucleotides) and of
	missense, nonsense, and silent substitution (at specific codons)
	both in the sequence as a whole and in a specific functional domain.
	Existing methods ignore features of the genetic code that allow some
	codons to mutate to missense, or stop, codons more readily than others
	(i.e., by one nucleotide change, vs. two or three). A new codon-based
	method to estimate the relative rate of substitution (fixation of
	a somatic mutation in a cancer cell lineage) of nonsense vs. missense
	mutations in different functional domains and in different tumor
	tissues is presented. Models that account for several potential influences
	on rates of somatic mutation and substitution in cancer progenitor
	cells and allow biases of mutation rates for particular dinucleotide
	sequences (CGs and dipyrimidines), transition vs. transversion bias,
	and variable rates of silent substitution across functional domains
	(useful in detecting investigator sampling bias) are considered.
	Likelihood-ratio tests are used to choose among models, using cancer
	gene mutation data. The method is applied to analyze published data
	on the spectrum of p53 mutations in cancers. A novel finding is that
	the ratio of the probability of nonsense to missense substitution
	is much lower in the DNA-binding and transactivation domains (ratios
	near 1) than in structural domains such as the linker, tetramerization
	(oligomerization), and proline-rich domains (ratios exceeding 100
	in some tissues), implying that the specific amino acid sequence
	may be less critical in structural domains (e.g., amino acid changes
	less often lead to cancer). The transition vs. transversion bias
	and effect of CpG dinucleotides on mutation rates in p53 varied greatly
	across cancers of different organs, likely reflecting effects of
	different endogenous and exogenous factors influencing mutation in

  abstract = {The nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio (omega = d(N)/d(S))
	provides a sensitive measure of selective pressure at the protein

	likelihood models of codon substitution developed recently account
	for variable selective pressures among amino acid sites by employing
	a statistical distribution for the omega ratio among sites. Those
	models, called random-sites models, are suitable when we do not know
	a priori which sites are under what kind of selective pressure. Sometimes
	prior information (such as the tertiary structure of the protein)
	might be available to partition sites in the protein into different
	classes, which are expected to be under different selective pressures.
	It is then sensible to use such information in the model. In this
	paper, we implement maximum likelihood models for prepartitioned
	data sets, which account for the heterogeneity among site partitions
	by using different omega parameters for the partitions. The models,
	referred to as fixed-sites models, are also useful for combined analysis
	of multiple genes from the same set of species. We apply the models
	to data sets of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
	I alleles from human populations and of the abalone sperm lysin genes.
	Structural information is used to partition sites in MHC into two
	classes: those in the antigen recognition site (ARS) and those outside.
	Positive selection is detected in the ARS by the fixed-sites models.
	Similarly, sites in lysin are classified into the buried and solvent-exposed
	classes according to the tertiary structure, and positive selection
	was detected at the solvent-exposed sites. The random-sites models
	identified a number of sites under positive selection in each data
	set, confirming and elaborating the results of the fixed-sites models.
	The analysis demonstrates the utility of the fixed-sites models,

	have been greatly elaborated, less attention has been paid to the
	effect of phenotype on the evolution of the genotype. Here we propose
	an evolutionary model and a Bayesian inference procedure that are
	aimed at filling this gap. In the model, RNA secondary structure
	links genotype and phenotype by treating the approximate free energy
	of a sequence folded into a secondary structure as a surrogate for
	fitness. The underlying idea is that a nucleotide substitution resulting
	in a more stable secondary structure should have a higher rate than
	a substitution that yields a less stable secondary structure. This
	free energy approach incorporates evolutionary dependencies among
	sequence positions beyond those that are reflected simply by jointly
	modeling change at paired positions in an RNA helix. Although there
	is not a formal requirement with this approach that secondary structure
	be known and nearly invariant over evolutionary time, computational
	considerations make these assumptions attractive and they have been
	adopted in a software program that permits statistical analysis of
	multiple homologous sequences that are related via a known phylogenetic
	tree topology. Analyses of 5S ribosomal RNA sequences are presented
	to illustrate and quantify the strong impact that RNA secondary structure

	to estimate substitution rates is the maximum-likelihood method implemented
	in the CODEML program in the PAML package. A limited number of branch
	models, chosen based on a priori information or an interest in a
	particular lineage(s), are tested, whereas a large number of potential

	test all or a large number of possible models to search for the globally
	optional model(s) of maximum likelihood. However, the computational
	time for this search even in a small number of sequences becomes
	impractically long. Thus, it is desirable to explore the most probable

	techniques, we developed a simple computational method for searching
	the most probable optimal branch-specific models in a practically
	feasible computational time. We propose three search methods to find

	2 and method 3) models when the given phylogeny has n branches. In

  abstract = {Detecting positive Darwinian selection at the DNA sequence level has
	been a subject of considerable interest. However, positive selection
	is difficult to detect because it often operates episodically on
	a few amino acid sites, and the signal may be masked by negative
	selection. Several methods have been developed to test positive selection
	that acts on given branches (branch methods) or on a subset of sites
	(site methods). Recently, Yang, Z., and R. Nielsen (2002. Codon-substitution
	models for detecting molecular adaptation at individual sites along
	specific lineages. Mol. Biol. Evol. 19:908-917) developed likelihood
	ratio tests (LRTs) based on branch-site models to detect positive
	selection that affects a small number of sites along prespecified
	lineages. However, computer simulations suggested that the tests
	were sensitive to the model assumptions and were unable to distinguish
	between relaxation of selective constraint and positive selection
	(Zhang, J. 2004. Frequent false detection of positive selection by
	the likelihood method with branch-site models. Mol. Biol. Evol. 21:1332-1339).
	Here, we describe a modified branch-site model and use it to construct
	two LRTs, called branch-site tests 1 and 2. We applied the new tests
	to reanalyze several real data sets and used computer simulation
	to examine the performance of the two tests by examining their false-positive
	rate, power, and robustness. We found that test 1 was unable to distinguish
	relaxed constraint from positive selection affecting the lineages
	of interest, while test 2 had acceptable false-positive rates and
	appeared robust against violations of model assumptions. As test
	2 is a direct test of positive selection on the lineages of interest,
	it is referred to as the branch-site test of positive selection and
	is recommended for use in real data analysis. The test appeared conservative
	overall, but exhibited better power in detecting positive selection
	than the branch-based test. Bayes empirical Bayes identification
	of amino acid sites under positive selection along the foreground
	branches was found to be reliable, but lacked power.},

  abstract = {Amino acid substitution and insertions/deletions (indels) are two
	common events in protein evolution; however, current knowledge on
	indels is limited. In this study, we investigated the effects of
	indels on the flanking regions in protein structure superfamilies.
	Comprehensive analysis of SCOP superfamilies revealed that indels
	lead to a series of changes in the flanking regions, including the
	following: (1) structural shift in the tertiary structure, with a
	first-order exponential decay relation between structural shift and
	the distance to indels, (2) instability of the secondary structure
	elements, in which parts of the alpha helix and beta sheet are destroyed,
	and (3) an increase in the amino acid substitution rate of the primary
	structure and the non-similar amino acid substitution rate. In general,
	these quality changes are due to the combined effects of the "regional-inherent
	effect (RIE)," "indel-accompanied effect (IDAE)," and "indel-following
	effect (IDFE)." Furthermore, these quality changes reflect changes
	in selective pressure. Indels are more likely to be preserved in
	regions with low selective pressure, and indels can further reduce
	the selective pressure on the flanking regions. These findings improve
	our understanding of the role of indels in protein evolution.},

  abstract = {The secondary structure of the 7SL RNA in the signal recognition particle
	was determined by applying both a theoretical and an experimental
	approach. The compensatory base change approach was taken comparing
	the published sequences of human, Drosophila and Xenopus 7SL RNA's.
	The deduced secondary structure was confirmed by post-labeling of
	an RNase V1-nicked dog SRP with P32-pCp and RNA-ligase and analysis
	of the labeled RNA-fragments by non-denaturing/denaturing 2D polyacrylamide
	gel electrophoresis. Two interesting features in the secondary structure
	were revealed: Firstly, bases at positions 122 to 127 of the human
	7SL RNA are not only able to pair with bases at positions 167 to
	170, but also with a single-stranded region of the bases at positions
	223 to 228, suggesting an alternative base pairing scheme for the
	7SL RNA in all three organisms. In agreement with this finding, four
	different conformations were identified after transcription of the
	7SL RNA from the genomic human clone. The involvement of the particular
	basepairing interaction postulated was confirmed by the analysis
	of a 7SL RNA deletion mutant (Sma1-409). Secondly, a significant
	sequence homology of the paired bases at positions 236 to 255 and
	104 to 109 in 7SL RNA with bases in 5S ribosomal RNA at the positions
	84 to 110 was noticed, suggesting that 5S ribosomal and 7SL RNA interact
	with the same target during protein biosynthesis. These findings
	are summarized by proposing a mechanism for the translational arrest
	of protein synthesis by the signal recognition particle using specific
	sequences and an alternative configuration in the 7SL RNA.},
