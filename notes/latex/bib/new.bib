  title = {High-Resolution Mapping of Crossovers Reveals Extensive Variation
	in Fine-Scale Recombination Patterns Among Humans.},

  abstract = {Recombination plays a crucial role in meiosis, ensuring the proper
	segregation of chromosomes. Recent linkage disequilibrium and sperm
	typing studies suggest that recombination rates vary tremendously
	across the human genome, with most events occurring in narrow "hotspots".
	To examine variation in fine-scale recombination patterns among individuals,
	we used dense, genome-wide SNP data collected in nuclear families
	to localize crossovers with high spatial resolution. This analysis
	revealed that overall recombination hotspot usage is similar in males
	and females, with individual hotspots often active in both sexes.
	Across the genome, approximately 60\% of crossovers occurred in hotspots
	inferred from studies of linkage disequilibrium. Remarkably, however,
	we found extensive and heritable variation among both males and females
	in the proportion of crossovers occurring in these hotspots.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: For several decades, free energy minimization methods
	have been the dominant strategy for single sequence RNA secondary
	structure prediction. More recently, stochastic context-free grammars
	(SCFGs) have emerged as an alternative probabilistic methodology
	for modeling RNA structure. Unlike physics-based methods, which rely
	on thousands of experimentally-measured thermodynamic parameters,
	SCFGs use fully-automated statistical learning algorithms to derive
	model parameters. Despite this advantage, however, probabilistic
	methods have not replaced free energy minimization methods as the
	tool of choice for secondary structure prediction, as the accuracies
	of the best current SCFGs have yet to match those of the best physics-based
	models. RESULTS: In this paper, we present CONTRAfold, a novel secondary
	structure prediction method based on conditional log-linear models
	(CLLMs), a flexible class of probabilistic models which generalize
	upon SCFGs by using discriminative training and feature-rich scoring.
	In a series of cross-validation experiments, we show that grammar-based
	secondary structure prediction methods formulated as CLLMs consistently
	outperform their SCFG analogs. Furthermore, CONTRAfold, a CLLM incorporating
	most of the features found in typical thermodynamic models, achieves
	the highest single sequence prediction accuracies to date, outperforming
	currently available probabilistic and physics-based techniques. Our
	result thus closes the gap between probabilistic and thermodynamic
	models, demonstrating that statistical learning procedures provide
	an effective alternative to empirical measurement of thermodynamic
	parameters for RNA secondary structure prediction. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {The coalescent process in the human-chimpanzee ancestral population

	period of gene flow during the speciation process. a is a parameter
	to represent the degree and time of gene flow, and the model is identical
	to the null model with an instantaneous species split when a=infinity.
	A maximum likelihood (ML) method is developed to estimate a, and
	its power and reliability is investigated by coalescent simulations.
	The ML method is applied to nucleotide divergence data between human
	and chimpanzee. It is found that the null model with an instantaneous
	species split explains the data best, and no strong evidence for
	gene flow is detected. The result is discussed in the view of the
	mode of speciation. Another ML method is developed to estimate the
	male-female ratio (alpha) of mutation rate, in which the coalescent
	process in the ancestral population is taken into account.},

	this variation and apply it to about 20 million base pairs of aligned
	sequence from humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and more distantly related
	primates. Human-chimpanzee genetic divergence varies from less than
	84\% to more than 147\% of the average, a range of more than 4 million
	years. Our analysis also shows that human-chimpanzee speciation occurred
	less than 6.3 million years ago and probably more recently, conflicting
	with some interpretations of ancient fossils. Most strikingly, chromosome
	X shows an extremely young genetic divergence time, close to the
	genome minimum along nearly its entire length. These unexpected features
	would be explained if the human and chimpanzee lineages initially
	diverged, then later exchanged genes before separating permanently.},
