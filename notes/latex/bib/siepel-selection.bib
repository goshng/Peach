  abstract = {The prevalence of recombination in eukaryotes poses one of the most
	puzzling questions in biology. The most compelling general explanation
	is that recombination facilitates selection by breaking down the
	negative associations generated by random drift (i.e. Hill-Robertson
	interference, HRI). I classify the effects of HRI owing to: deleterious
	mutation, balancing selection and selective sweeps on: neutral diversity,
	rates of adaptation and the mutation load. These effects are mediated
	primarily by the density of deleterious mutations and of selective
	sweeps. Sequence polymorphism and divergence suggest that these rates
	may be high enough to cause significant interference even in genomic
	regions of high recombination. However, neither seems able to generate
	enough variance in fitness to select strongly for high rates of recombination.
	It is plausible that spatial and temporal fluctuations in selection
	generate much more fitness variance, and hence selection for recombination,
	than can be explained by uniformly deleterious mutations or species-wide
	selective sweeps.},

  abstract = {If distinct biological species are to coexist in sympatry, they must
	be reproductively isolated and must exploit different limiting resources.
	A two-niche Levene model is analysed, in which habitat preference
	and survival depend on underlying additive traits. The population
	genetics of preference and viability are equivalent. However, there
	is a linear trade-off between the chances of settling in either niche,
	whereas viabilities may be constrained arbitrarily. With a convex
	trade-off, a sexual population evolves a single generalist genotype,
	whereas with a concave trade-off, disruptive selection favours maximal
	variance. A pure habitat preference evolves to global linkage equilibrium
	if mating occurs in a single pool, but remarkably, evolves to pairwise
	linkage equilibrium within niches if mating is within those niches--independent
	of the genetics. With a concave trade-off, the population shifts
	sharply between a unimodal distribution with high gene flow and a
	bimodal distribution with strong isolation, as the underlying genetic
	variance increases. However, these alternative states are only simultaneously
	stable for a narrow parameter range. A sharp threshold is only seen
	if survival in the 'wrong' niche is low; otherwise, strong isolation
	is impossible. Gene flow from divergent demes makes speciation much
	easier in parapatry than in sympatry.},

  abstract = {Under the classical view, selection depends more or less directly
	on mutation: standing genetic variance is maintained by a balance
	between selection and mutation, and adaptation is fuelled by new
	favourable mutations. Recombination is favoured if it breaks negative
	associations among selected alleles, which interfere with adaptation.
	Such associations may be generated by negative epistasis, or by random
	drift (leading to the Hill-Robertson effect). Both deterministic
	and stochastic explanations depend primarily on the genomic mutation
	rate, U. This may be large enough to explain high recombination rates
	in some organisms, but seems unlikely to be so in general. Random
	drift is a more general source of negative linkage disequilibria,
	and can cause selection for recombination even in large populations,
	through the chance loss of new favourable mutations. The rate of
	species-wide substitutions is much too low to drive this mechanism,
	but local fluctuations in selection, combined with gene flow, may
	suffice. These arguments are illustrated by comparing the interaction

	to find the effect of substitutions, fluctuating polymorphisms, and
	deleterious mutations in a large population. With loose linkage,
	r, the effects depend on the additive genetic variance in relative
	fitness, var(W), and act by reducing effective population size by
	(N/Ne) = 1 + var(W)/2r2. However, tightly linked loci can have a
	substantial effect not predictable from Ne. Linked deleterious mutations
	reduce the fixation probability of weakly favored alleles by exp
	(-2U/R), where U is the total mutation rate and R is the map length
	in Morgans. Substitutions can cause a greater reduction: an allele
	with advantage s < scrit = (pi 2/6) loge (S/s) [var(W)/R] is very
	unlikely to be fixed. (S is the advantage of the substitution impeding
	fixation.) Fluctuating polymorphisms at many (n) linked loci can
	also have a substantial effect, reducing fixation probability by

  abstract = {Quantifying the distribution of fitness effects among newly arising
	mutations in the human genome is key to resolving important debates
	in medical and evolutionary genetics. Here, we present a method for
	inferring this distribution using Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
	(SNP) data from a population with non-stationary demographic history
	(such as that of modern humans). Application of our method to 47,576
	coding SNPs found by direct resequencing of 11,404 protein coding-genes
	in 35 individuals (20 European Americans and 15 African Americans)
	allows us to assess the relative contribution of demographic and
	selective effects to patterning amino acid variation in the human
	genome. We find evidence of an ancient population expansion in the
	sample with African ancestry and a relatively recent bottleneck in
	the sample with European ancestry. After accounting for these demographic
	effects, we find strong evidence for great variability in the selective
	effects of new amino acid replacing mutations. In both populations,
	the patterns of variation are consistent with a leptokurtic distribution
	of selection coefficients (e.g., gamma or log-normal) peaked near
	neutrality. Specifically, we predict 27-29\% of amino acid changing
	(nonsynonymous) mutations are neutral or nearly neutral (|s|<0.01\%),
	30-42\% are moderately deleterious (0.01\%<|s|<1\%), and nearly all
	the remainder are highly deleterious or lethal (|s|>1\%). Our results
	are consistent with 10-20\% of amino acid differences between humans
	and chimpanzees having been fixed by positive selection with the
	remainder of differences being neutral or nearly neutral. Our analysis
	also predicts that many of the alleles identified via whole-genome
	association mapping may be selectively neutral or (formerly) positively
	selected, implying that deleterious genetic variation affecting disease
	phenotype may be missed by this widely used approach for mapping
	genes underlying complex traits.},

	a widespread role for adaptive protein evolution in certain taxa.
	For example, estimates of the proportion of adaptive amino acid substitutions

	of these tests, we introduce a new computational method that can
	model complex population histories with migration and changing population

	We demonstrate that iHS performs substantially better than the other

	that the single-site iHS statistic is more powerful in a candidate
	gene test than the multi-site statistic, but that the multi-site

	For Drosophila populations, we estimate that the shape parameter

	We apply a newly developed method to DNA sequence polymorphism data

	of the distribution of the heterozygous fitness effects of amino
	acid mutations for several different distribution functions. The
	results exclude normal and gamma distributions, since these predict

	as a result of predicting too many lethals. Only the lognormal distribution
	appears to fit both the diversity data and the frequency of lethals.
	This DDME arises naturally in complex systems when independent factors
	contribute multiplicatively to an increase in fitness-reducing damage.
	Several important parameters, such as the fraction of effectively
	neutral non-synonymous mutations and the harmonic mean of non-neutral
	selection coefficients, are robust to the form of the DDME. Our results
	suggest that the majority of non-synonymous mutations in Drosophila

	However, positive selection is not the only process that can lead

	the effects of positive selection: the shape of average neutral diversity

	more reliable inferences about the prevalence and strength of adaptation.
	Specifically, we develop a coalescent-based model for the shape of
	the entire curve and use it to infer adaptive parameters by maximum

	cause selective sweeps. Interestingly, it reveals two classes of
	beneficial fixations: a minority (approximately 3\%) that appears

	reduction in diversity, and the remaining 10\%, which seem to have
	had very weak selective effects. These estimates therefore help to
	reconcile the apparent conflict among previously published estimates

	that mutational effects are unconditionally deleterious, by including
	a fraction of positively selected mutations. We allow one or more
	classes of positive selection coefficients in the model and estimate
	both the fraction of mutations that are advantageous and the strength
	of selection acting on them. We show by simulations that the method
	is capable of recovering the parameters of the DFE under a range
	of conditions. We apply the method to two data sets on multiple protein-coding
	genes from African populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We use
	a probabilistic reconstruction of the ancestral states of the polymorphic
	sites to distinguish between derived and ancestral states at polymorphic
	nucleotide sites. In both data sets, we see a significant improvement
	in the fit when a category of positively selected amino acid mutations
	is included, but no further improvement if additional categories
	are added. We estimate that between 1\% and 2\% of new nonsynonymous
	mutations in D. melanogaster are positively selected, with a scaled
	selection coefficient representing the product of the effective population
	size, N(e), and the strength of selection on heterozygous carriers

	is central to our understanding of molecular evolution. A suitable
	observation for this purpose would consist of polymorphic data on
	a large and unbiased collection of genes from two closely related
	species, each having a large and stable population. In this study,
	we sequenced 419 genes from 24 lines of Drosophila melanogaster and
	its close relatives. Together with data from Drosophila simulans,
	these data reveal the following. (i) Approximately 10\% of the loci
	in regions of normal recombination are much less polymorphic at silent
	sites than expected, hinting at the action of selective sweeps. (ii)
	The level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with the rate
	of nonsynonymous divergence across loci. Thus, even under strict
	neutrality, the ratio of amino acid to silent nucleotide changes
	(A:S) between Drosophila species is expected to be 25-40\% higher
	than the A:S ratio for polymorphism when data are pooled across the
	genome. (iii) The observed A/S ratio between species among the 419
	loci is 28.9\% higher than the (adjusted) neutral expectation. We
	estimate that nearly 30\% of the amino acid substitutions between
	D. melanogaster and its close relatives were adaptive. (iv) This
	signature of adaptive evolution is observable only in regions of
	normal recombination. Hence, the low level of polymorphism observed
	in regions of reduced recombination may not be driven primarily by
	positive selection. Finally, we discuss the theories and data pertaining
	to the interpretation of adaptive evolution in genomic studies.},
