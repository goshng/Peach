  abstract = {In spite of its evolutionary significance and conservation importance,
	the population structure of the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes,
	is still poorly understood. An issue of particular controversy is
	whether the proposed fourth subspecies of chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes
	ellioti, from parts of Nigeria and Cameroon, is genetically distinct.
	Although modern high-throughput SNP genotyping has had a major impact
	on our understanding of human population structure and demographic
	history, its application to ecological, demographic, or conservation
	questions in non-human species has been extremely limited. Here we
	apply these tools to chimpanzee population structure, using ?700
	autosomal SNPs derived from chimpanzee genomic data and a further
	?100 SNPs from targeted re-sequencing. We demonstrate conclusively
	the existence of P. t. ellioti as a genetically distinct subgroup.
	We show that there is clear differentiation between the verus, troglodytes,
	and ellioti populations at the SNP and haplotype level, on a scale
	that is greater than that separating continental human populations.
	Further, we show that only a small set of SNPs (10-20) is needed
	to successfully assign individuals to these populations. Tellingly,
	use of only mitochondrial DNA variation to classify individuals is
	erroneous in 4 of 54 cases, reinforcing the dangers of basing demographic
	inference on a single locus and implying that the demographic history
	of the species is more complicated than that suggested analyses based
	solely on mtDNA. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of
	developing economical and robust tests of individual chimpanzee origin
	as well as in-depth studies of population structure. These findings
	have important implications for conservation strategies and our understanding
	of the evolution of chimpanzees. They also act as a proof-of-principle
	for the use of cheap high-throughput genomic methods for ecological
	questions.},

	million cases of serious disease and 826,000 deaths annually in children

	PCV7 pneumococcal vaccine in 2000 in the United States(2,3) provided
	an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the response of an important
	pathogen to widespread, vaccine-induced selective pressure. Here,
	we use array-based sequencing of 62 isolates from a US national monitoring
	program to study five independent instances of vaccine escape recombination(4),
	showing the simultaneous transfer of multiple and often large (up
	to at least 44 kb) DNA fragments. We show that one such new strain
	quickly became established, spreading from east to west across the
	United States. These observations clarify the roles of recombination
	and selection in the population genomics of pneumococcus and provide
	proof of principle of the considerable value of combining genomic
	and epidemiological information in the surveillance and enhanced
	understanding of infectious diseases.},

  abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing offers new insights into the evolution of
	bacterial pathogens and the etiology of bacterial disease. Staphylococcus
	aureus is a major cause of bacteria-associated mortality and invasive
	disease and is carried asymptomatically by 27\% of adults. Eighty
	percent of bacteremias match the carried strain. However, the role
	of evolutionary change in the pathogen during the progression from
	carriage to disease is incompletely understood. Here we use high-throughput
	genome sequencing to discover the genetic changes that accompany
	the transition from nasal carriage to fatal bloodstream infection
	in an individual colonized with methicillin-sensitive S. aureus.
	We found a single, cohesive population exhibiting a repertoire of
	30 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four insertion/deletion variants.
	Mutations accumulated at a steady rate over a 13-mo period, except
	for a cluster of mutations preceding the transition to disease. Although
	bloodstream bacteria differed by just eight mutations from the original
	nasally carried bacteria, half of those mutations caused truncation
	of proteins, including a premature stop codon in an AraC-family transcriptional
	regulator that has been implicated in pathogenicity. Comparison with
	evolution in two asymptomatic carriers supported the conclusion that
	clusters of protein-truncating mutations are highly unusual. Our
	results demonstrate that bacterial diversity in vivo is limited but
	nonetheless detectable by whole-genome sequencing, enabling the study
	of evolutionary dynamics within the host. Regulatory or structural
	changes that occur during carriage may be functionally important
	for pathogenesis; therefore identifying those changes is a crucial
	step in understanding the biological causes of invasive bacterial
	disease.},
