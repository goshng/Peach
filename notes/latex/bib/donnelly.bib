  abstract = {In spite of its evolutionary significance and conservation importance,
	the population structure of the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes,
	is still poorly understood. An issue of particular controversy is
	whether the proposed fourth subspecies of chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes
	ellioti, from parts of Nigeria and Cameroon, is genetically distinct.
	Although modern high-throughput SNP genotyping has had a major impact
	on our understanding of human population structure and demographic
	history, its application to ecological, demographic, or conservation
	questions in non-human species has been extremely limited. Here we
	apply these tools to chimpanzee population structure, using ?700
	autosomal SNPs derived from chimpanzee genomic data and a further
	?100 SNPs from targeted re-sequencing. We demonstrate conclusively
	the existence of P. t. ellioti as a genetically distinct subgroup.
	We show that there is clear differentiation between the verus, troglodytes,
	and ellioti populations at the SNP and haplotype level, on a scale
	that is greater than that separating continental human populations.
	Further, we show that only a small set of SNPs (10-20) is needed
	to successfully assign individuals to these populations. Tellingly,
	use of only mitochondrial DNA variation to classify individuals is
	erroneous in 4 of 54 cases, reinforcing the dangers of basing demographic
	inference on a single locus and implying that the demographic history
	of the species is more complicated than that suggested analyses based
	solely on mtDNA. In this study we demonstrate the feasibility of
	developing economical and robust tests of individual chimpanzee origin
	as well as in-depth studies of population structure. These findings
	have important implications for conservation strategies and our understanding
	of the evolution of chimpanzees. They also act as a proof-of-principle
	for the use of cheap high-throughput genomic methods for ecological
	questions.},

  abstract = {Genotype imputation methods are now being widely used in the analysis
	of genome-wide association studies. Most imputation analyses to date
	have used the HapMap as a reference dataset, but new reference panels
	(such as controls genotyped on multiple SNP chips and densely typed
	samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project) will soon allow a broader
	range of SNPs to be imputed with higher accuracy, thereby increasing
	power. We describe a genotype imputation method (IMPUTE version 2)
	that is designed to address the challenges presented by these new
	datasets. The main innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling
	framework that increases accuracy and combines information across
	multiple reference panels while remaining computationally feasible.
	We find that IMPUTE v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods
	when the HapMap provides the sole reference panel, but that the size
	of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made. We also
	find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by expanding
	the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes and that
	IMPUTE v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at both rare
	and common SNPs, with overall error rates that are 15\%-20\% lower
	than those of the closest competing method. One particularly challenging
	aspect of next-generation association studies is to integrate information
	across multiple reference panels genotyped on different sets of SNPs;
	we show that our approach to this problem has practical advantages
	over other suggested solutions.},

	our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework

	enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight
	the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and
	application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators

	percent of bacteremias match the carried strain. However, the role
	of evolutionary change in the pathogen during the progression from

	the transition from nasal carriage to fatal bloodstream infection

	We found a single, cohesive population exhibiting a repertoire of
	30 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and four insertion/deletion variants.
	Mutations accumulated at a steady rate over a 13-mo period, except
	for a cluster of mutations preceding the transition to disease. Although
	bloodstream bacteria differed by just eight mutations from the original
	nasally carried bacteria, half of those mutations caused truncation
	of proteins, including a premature stop codon in an AraC-family transcriptional
	regulator that has been implicated in pathogenicity. Comparison with
	evolution in two asymptomatic carriers supported the conclusion that
	clusters of protein-truncating mutations are highly unusual. Our
	results demonstrate that bacterial diversity in vivo is limited but
	nonetheless detectable by whole-genome sequencing, enabling the study

	changes that occur during carriage may be functionally important
	for pathogenesis; therefore identifying those changes is a crucial

  journal = {BMC Genet},
  year = {2012},
  volume = {13},
  pages = {6},
  abstract = {The advent of high throughput sequencing technology has enabled the
	1000 Genomes Project Pilot 3 to generate complete sequence data for
	more than 906 genes and 8,140 exons representing 697 subjects. The
	1000 Genomes database provides a critical opportunity for further
	interpreting disease associations with single nucleotide polymorphisms
	(SNPs) discovered from genetic association studies. Currently, direct
	sequencing of candidate genes or regions on a large number of subjects
	remains both cost- and time-prohibitive.To accelerate the translation
	from discovery to functional studies, we propose an in silico gene
	sequencing method (ISS), which predicts phased sequences of intragenic
	regions, using SNPs. The key underlying idea of our method is to
	infer diploid sequences (a pair of phased sequences/alleles) at every
	functional locus utilizing the deep sequencing data from the 1000
	Genomes Project and SNP data from the HapMap Project, and to build
	prediction models using flanking SNPs. Using this method, we have
	developed a database of prediction models for 611 known genes. Sequence
	prediction accuracy for these genes is 96.26\% on average (ranges
	79\%-100\%). This database of prediction models can be enhanced and
	scaled up to include new genes as the 1000 Genomes Project sequences
	additional genes on additional individuals. Applying our predictive
	model for the KCNJ11 gene to the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium
	(WTCCC) Type 2 diabetes cohort, we demonstrate how the prediction
	of phased sequences inferred from GWAS SNP genotype data can be used
	to facilitate interpretation and identify a probable functional mechanism
	such as protein changes.Prior to the general availability of routine
	sequencing of all subjects, the ISS method proposed here provides
	a time- and cost-effective approach to broadening the characterization
	of disease associated SNPs and regions, and facilitating the prioritization
	of candidate genes for more detailed functional and mechanistic studies.},
