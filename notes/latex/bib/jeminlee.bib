  abstract = {We present a new approach to genotyping based on multiplexed shotgun
	sequencing that can identify recombination breakpoints in a large
	number of individuals simultaneously at a resolution sufficient for
	most mapping purposes, such as quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping
	and mapping of induced mutations. We first describe a simple library
	construction protocol that uses just 10 ng of genomic DNA per individual
	and makes the approach accessible to any laboratory with standard
	molecular biology equipment. Sequencing this library results in a
	large number of sequence reads widely distributed across the genomes
	of multiplexed bar-coded individuals. We develop a Hidden Markov
	Model to estimate ancestry at all genomic locations in all individuals
	using these data. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by mapping
	a dominant marker allele in D. simulans to within 105 kb of its true
	position using 96 F1-backcross individuals genotyped in a single
	lane on an Illumina Genome Analyzer. We further demonstrate the utility
	of our method by genetically mapping more than 400 previously unassembled
	D. simulans contigs to linkage groups and by evaluating the quality
	of targeted introgression lines. At this level of multiplexing and
	divergence between strains, our method allows estimation of recombination
	breakpoints to a median of 38-kb intervals. Our analysis suggests
	that higher levels of multiplexing and/or use of strains with lower
	levels of divergence are practicable.},

  abstract = {How often do the early stages of speciation occur in the presence
	of gene flow? To address this enduring question, a number of recent
	papers have used computational approaches, estimating parameters
	of simple divergence models from multilocus polymorphism data collected
	in closely related species. Applications to a variety of species
	have yielded extensive evidence for migration, with the results interpreted
	as supporting the widespread occurrence of parapatric speciation.
	Here, we conduct a simulation study to assess the reliability of
	such inferences, using a program that we recently developed MCMC
	estimation of the isolation-migration model allowing for recombination
	(MIMAR) as well as the program isolation-migration (IM) of Hey and
	Nielsen (2004). We find that when one of many assumptions of the
	isolation-migration model is violated, the methods tend to yield
	biased estimates of the parameters, potentially lending spurious
	support for allopatric or parapatric divergence. More generally,
	our results highlight the difficulty in drawing inferences about
	modes of speciation from the existing computational approaches alone.},

	that new sequencing technology combined with traditional genetic

	we used phenotype-based introgression to backcross loci that control
	innate food preference in Drosophila simulans into the genomic background

	mapped D. simulans introgression regions in a small mapping population
	(30 flies) with whole-genome resequencing using light coverage (?1×).
	We found six loci contributing to D. simulans food preference, one
	of which overlaps a previously discovered allele. This approach is
	applicable to many systems, does not rely on laborious marker development
	or genotyping, does not require existing high quality reference genomes,
	and needs only small mapping populations. Because introgression is
	used, researchers can scale mapping population size, replication,
	and number of backcross generations to their needs. Finally, in contrast
	to more widely used mapping techniques like F(2) bulk-segregant analysis,
	our method produces near-isogenic lines that can be kept and reused

	cinerea). Partial resistance to this fungus has been identified in
	accessions of wild relatives of tomato such as Solanum habrochaites
	LYC4. In a previous F(2) mapping study, three QTLs conferring resistance
	to B. cinerea (Rbcq1, Rbcq2 and Rbcq4a) were identified. As it was
	probable that this study had not identified all QTLs involved in
	resistance we developed an introgression line (IL) population (n
	= 30), each containing a S. habrochaites introgression in the S.
	lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker genetic background. On average each IL
	contained 5.2\% of the S. habrochaites genome and together the lines
	provide an estimated coverage of 95\%. The level of susceptibility
	to B. cinerea for each of the ILs was assessed in a greenhouse trial
	and compared to the susceptible parent S. lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker.
	The effect of the three previously identified loci could be confirmed
	and seven additional loci were detected. Some ILs contains multiple
	QTLs and the increased resistance to B. cinerea in these ILs is in
	line with a completely additive model. We conclude that this set
	of QTLs offers good perspectives for breeding of B. cinerea resistant
	cultivars and that screening an IL population is more sensitive for
	detection of QTLs conferring resistance to B. cinerea than the analysis
	in an F(2) population.},

	advantages of this system for Ecological and Evolutionary Functional
	Genomics (EEFG), and outline several ecological and evolutionary
	phenotypes and questions that can be fruitfully tackled in this system.
	These include biotic and abiotic adaptation, reproductive trait evolution,

	1.44·N generations ago, where N is the effective population size

	published methods to infer speciation parameters under the isolation-migration

	We have developed two improvements of these methods based on a more

	high intra-locus recombination rates. First, using a likelihood based
	method, we demonstrate that taking into account low-frequency polymorphisms
	shared between species significantly improves the joint estimation
	of the divergence time and gene flow between species. Second, we
	introduce a local linear regression algorithm that considerably reduces
	the computational time and allows for the estimation of unequal rates
	of gene flow between species. We also investigate which summary statistics
	from the JSFS allow the greatest estimation accuracy for divergence
	time and migration rates for low (around 10) and high (around 100)
	numbers of loci. Focusing on cases with low numbers of loci and high
