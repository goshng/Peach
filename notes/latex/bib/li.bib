  abstract = {The molecular clock hypothesis postulates that the rate of molecular
	evolution is approximately constant over time. Although this hypothesis
	has been highly controversial in the past, it is now widely accepted.
	The assumption of rate constancy has often been taken as a basis
	for reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships among organisms
	or genes and for dating evolutionary events. Further, it has been
	taken as strong support for the neutral mutation hypothesis, which
	postulates that the majority of molecular changes in evolution are
	due to neutral or nearly neutral mutations. For these reasons, the
	validity of the rate constancy assumption is a vital issue in molecular
	evolution. Recent studies using DNA sequence data have raised serious
	doubts about the hypothesis. These studies provided support for the
	suggestion made from immunological distance and protein sequence
	data that a rate slowdown has occurred in hominoid evolution, and
	showed, in agreement with DNA hybridization studies, that rates of
	nucleotide substitution are significantly higher in rodents than
	in man. Here, rates of nucleotide substitution in rodents are estimated
	to be 4-10 times higher than those in higher primates and 2-4 times
	higher than those in artiodactyls. Further, this study provides strong
	evidence for the hominoid slowdown hypothesis and suggests a further
	rate-slowdown in hominoid evolution. Our results suggest that the
	variation in rate among mammals is primarily due to differences in
	generation time rather than changes in DNA repair mechanisms. We
	also propose a method for estimating the divergence times between
	species when the rate constancy assumption is violated.},

  abstract = {When the coding regions of 11 genes from rodents (mouse or rat) and
	man are compared with those from another mammalian species (usually
	bovine), it is found that rodents evolve significantly faster than
	man. The ratio of the number of nucleotide substitutions in the rodent
	lineage to that in the human lineage since their divergence is 2.0
	for synonymous substitutions and 1.3 for nonsynonymous substitutions.
	Rodents also evolve faster in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions
	of five different mRNAs; the ratios are 2.6 and 3.1, respectively.
	The numbers of nucleotide substitutions between members of the beta-globin
	gene family that were duplicated before the man-mouse split are also
	higher in mouse than in man. The difference is, again, greater for
	synonymous substitutions than for nonsynonymous substitutions. This
	tendency is more consistent with the neutralist view of molecular
	evolution than with the selectionist view. A simple explanation for
	the higher rates in rodents is that rodents have shorter generation
	times and, thus, higher mutation rates. The implication of our findings
	for the study of molecular phylogeny is discussed.},
