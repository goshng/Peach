  abstract = {Measuring the effects of base mutations is a powerful tool for functional
	and evolutionary analyses of RNA structures. To date, only a few
	methods have been developed for systematically computing the thermodynamic
	changes of RNA secondary structures in response to base mutations.We
	have developed algorithms for computing the changes of the ensemble
	free energy, mean energy and the thermodynamic entropy of RNA secondary
	structures for exhaustive patterns of single and double mutations.
	The computational complexities are O(NW(2)) (where N is sequence
	length and W is maximal base pair span) for single mutations and
	O(N(2)W(2)) for double mutations with large constant factors. We
	show that the changes are relatively insensitive to GC composition
	and the maximal span constraint. The mean free energy changes are
	bounded ~7-9 kcal/mol and depend only weakly on position if sequence
	lengths are sufficiently large. For tRNA sequences, the most stabilizing
	mutations come from the change of the 5(')-most base of the anticodon
	loop. We also show that most of the base changes in the acceptor
	stem destabilize the structures, indicating that the nucleotide sequence
	in the acceptor stem is highly optimized for secondary structure
	stability. We investigate the 22 tRNA genes in the human mitochondrial
	genome and show that non-pathogenic polymorphisms tend to cause smaller
	changes in thermodynamic variables than generic mutations, suggesting
	that a mutation which largely increases thermodynamic variables has
	higher possibility to be a pathogenic or lethal mutation. Availability
	and implementation: The C++ source code of the Rchange software is

  abstract = {Although probabilistic models of genotype (e.g., DNA sequence) evolution
	have been greatly elaborated, less attention has been paid to the
	effect of phenotype on the evolution of the genotype. Here we propose
	an evolutionary model and a Bayesian inference procedure that are
	aimed at filling this gap. In the model, RNA secondary structure
	links genotype and phenotype by treating the approximate free energy
	of a sequence folded into a secondary structure as a surrogate for
	fitness. The underlying idea is that a nucleotide substitution resulting
	in a more stable secondary structure should have a higher rate than
	a substitution that yields a less stable secondary structure. This
	free energy approach incorporates evolutionary dependencies among
	sequence positions beyond those that are reflected simply by jointly
	modeling change at paired positions in an RNA helix. Although there
	is not a formal requirement with this approach that secondary structure
	be known and nearly invariant over evolutionary time, computational
	considerations make these assumptions attractive and they have been
	adopted in a software program that permits statistical analysis of
	multiple homologous sequences that are related via a known phylogenetic
	tree topology. Analyses of 5S ribosomal RNA sequences are presented
	to illustrate and quantify the strong impact that RNA secondary structure
	has on substitution rates. Analyses on simulated sequences show that
	the new inference procedure has reasonable statistical properties.
	Potential applications of this procedure, including improved ancestral
	sequence inference and location of functionally interesting sites,
	are discussed.},
