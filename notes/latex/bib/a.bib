  abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) plays a central role in nearly all
	bioinformatics and molecular evolutionary applications. MSA reconstruction
	is thus one of the most heavily scrutinized bioinformatics fields.
	Evaluating the quality of MSA reconstruction is often hindered by
	the lack of good reference MSAs. The use of sequence evolution simulation
	can provide such reference MSAs. Furthermore, none of the MSA viewing/editing
	programs currently available allows the user to make direct comparisons
	between two or more MSAs. Considering the importance of MSA quality
	in a wide range of research, it is desirable if MSA assessment can
	be performed more easily.We have developed SuiteMSA, a java-based
	application that provides unique MSA viewers. Users can directly
	compare multiple MSAs and evaluate where the MSAs agree (are consistent)
	or disagree (are inconsistent). Several alignment statistics are
	provided to assist such comparisons. SuiteMSA also includes a graphical
	phylogeny editor/viewer as well as a graphical user interface for
	a sequence evolution simulator that can be used to construct reference
	MSAs.SuiteMSA provides researchers easy access to a sequence evolution
	simulator, reference alignments generated by the simulator, and a
	series of tools to evaluate the performance of the MSA reconstruction
	programs. It will help us improve the quality of MSAs, often the
	most important first steps of bioinformatics and other biological
	research.},

  title = {BRANCH: boosting RNA-Seq assemblies with partial or related genomic
	sequences.},
  journal = {Bioinformatics},
  year = {2013},
  month = {Apr},
  abstract = {MOTIVATION: De novo transcriptome assemblies of RNA-Seq data are important
	for genomics applications of unsequenced organisms. Owing to the
	complexity and often incomplete representation of transcripts in
	sequencing libraries, the assembly of high-quality transcriptomes
	can be challenging. However, with the rapidly growing number of sequenced
	genomes, it is now feasible to improve RNA-Seq assemblies by guiding
	them with genomic sequences. RESULTS: This study introduces BRANCH,
	an algorithm designed for improving de novo transcriptome assemblies
	by using genomic information that can be partial or complete genome
	sequences from the same or a related organism. Its input includes
	assembled RNA reads (transfrags), genomic sequences (e.g. contigs)
	and the RNA reads themselves. It uses a customized version of BLAT
	to align the transfrags and RNA reads to the genomic sequences. After
	identifying exons from the alignments, it defines a directed acyclic
	graph and maps the transfrags to paths on the graph. It then joins
	and extends the transfrags by applying an algorithm that solves a
	combinatorial optimization problem, called the Minimum weight Minimum
	Path Cover with given Paths. In performance tests on real data from
	Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, assisted by
	genomic contigs from the same species, BRANCH improved the sensitivity
	and precision of transfrags generated by Velvet/Oases or Trinity
	by 5.1-56.7\% and 0.3-10.5\%, respectively. These improvements added
	3.8-74.1\% complete transcripts and 8.3-3.8\% proteins to the initial
	assembly. Similar improvements were achieved when guiding the BRANCH
	processing of a transcriptome assembly from a more complex organism
	(mouse) with genomic sequences from a related species (rat). AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {By virtue of their shared ancestry, homologous sequences are similar
	in their structure and function. Consequently, multiple sequence
	alignments are routinely used to identify trends that relate to function.
	This type of analysis is particularly productive when it is combined
	with structural and phylogenetic analysis.Here we describe the release
	of PFAAT version 2.0, a tool for editing, analyzing, and annotating
	multiple sequence alignments. Support for multiple annotations is
	a key component of this release as it provides a framework for most
	of the new functionalities. The sequence annotations are accessible
	from the alignment and tree, where they are typically used to label
	sequences or hyperlink them to related databases. Sequence annotations
	can be created manually or extracted automatically from UniProt entries.
	Once a multiple sequence alignment is populated with sequence annotations,
	sequences can be easily selected and sorted through a sophisticated
	search dialog. The selected sequences can be further analyzed using
	statistical methods that explicitly model relationships between the
	sequence annotations and residue properties. Residue annotations
	are accessible from the alignment viewer and are typically used to
	designate binding sites or properties for a particular residue. Residue
	annotations are also searchable, and allow one to quickly select
	alignment columns for further sequence analysis, e.g. computing percent
	identities. Other features include: novel algorithms to compute sequence
	conservation, mapping conservation scores to a 3D structure in Jmol,
	displaying secondary structure elements, and sorting sequences by
	residue composition.PFAAT provides a framework whereby end-users
	can specify knowledge for a protein family in the form of annotation.
	The annotations can be combined with sophisticated analysis to test
	hypothesis that relate to sequence, structure and function.},

	annotate eukaryotic genomes and create genome databases. MAKER identifies
	repeats, aligns ESTs and proteins to a genome, produces ab initio
	gene predictions, and automatically synthesizes these data into gene
	annotations having evidence-based quality indices. MAKER is also
	easily trainable: Outputs of preliminary runs are used to automatically
	retrain its gene-prediction algorithm, producing higher-quality gene-models
	on subsequent runs. MAKER's inputs are minimal, and its outputs can
	be used to create a GMOD database. Its outputs can also be viewed
	in the Apollo Genome browser; this feature of MAKER provides an easy
	means to annotate, view, and edit individual contigs and BACs without
	the overhead of a database. As proof of principle, we have used MAKER
	to annotate the genome of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and
	to create a new genome database, SmedGD. We have also compared MAKER's
	performance to other published annotation pipelines. Our results
	demonstrate that MAKER provides a simple and effective means to convert

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {268},
  abstract = {Although testing for simultaneous divergence (vicariance) across different
	population-pairs that span the same barrier to gene flow is of central
	importance to evolutionary biology, researchers often equate the
	gene tree and population/species tree thereby ignoring stochastic
	coalescent variance in their conclusions of temporal incongruence.
	In contrast to other available phylogeographic software packages,
	msBayes is the only one that analyses data from multiple species/population
	pairs under a hierarchical model.msBayes employs approximate Bayesian
	computation (ABC) under a hierarchical coalescent model to test for
	simultaneous divergence (TSD) in multiple co-distributed population-pairs.
	Simultaneous isolation is tested by estimating three hyper-parameters
	that characterize the degree of variability in divergence times across
	co-distributed population pairs while allowing for variation in various
	within population-pair demographic parameters (sub-parameters) that
	can affect the coalescent. msBayes is a software package consisting
	of several C and R programs that are run with a Perl "front-end".The
	method reasonably distinguishes simultaneous isolation from temporal
	incongruence in the divergence of co-distributed population pairs,
	even with sparse sampling of individuals. Because the estimate step
	is decoupled from the simulation step, one can rapidly evaluate different
	ABC acceptance/rejection conditions and the choice of summary statistics.
	Given the complex and idiosyncratic nature of testing multi-species
	biogeographic hypotheses, we envision msBayes as a powerful and flexible
	tool for tackling a wide array of difficult research questions that
	use population genetic data from multiple co-distributed species.
	The msBayes pipeline is available for download at http://msbayes.sourceforge.net/
	under an open source license (GNU Public License). The msBayes pipeline
	is comprised of several C and R programs that are run with a Perl
	"front-end" and runs on Linux, Mac OS-X, and most POSIX systems.
	Although the current implementation is for a single locus per species-pair,
	future implementations will allow analysis of multi-loci data per
	species pair.},

	under a coalescent model to infer temporal patterns of divergence

	multiple codistributed taxa that diverge into taxon-pairs with subsequent
	gene flow or isolation, one can estimate hyper-parameters that quantify
	the mean and variability in divergence times or test models of migration
	and isolation. The software uses multi-locus DNA sequence data collected
	from multiple taxon-pairs and allows variation across taxa in demographic
	parameters as well as heterogeneity in DNA mutation rates across
	loci. The method also allows a flexible sampling scheme: different
	numbers of loci of varying length can be sampled from different taxon-pairs.Simulation
	tests reveal increasing power with increasing numbers of loci when
	attempting to distinguish temporal congruence from incongruence in
	divergence times across taxon-pairs. These results are robust to
	DNA mutation rate heterogeneity. Estimating mean divergence times

	validation tests demonstrated that one can detect the correct migration
	or isolation model with high probability, and that this HABC model

	Therefore understanding the various properties of contact maps is
	an important step in protein structure prediction. For investigating
	basic properties of contact formation and contact clusters we set
	up an integrated system called Contact Map Web Viewer, or CMWeb for
	short. The server can be used to visualize contact maps, to link
	contacts and to show them both in 3D structures and in multiple sequence
	alignments and to calculate various statistics on contacts. Moreover,
	we have implemented five contact prediction methods in the CMWeb
	server to visualize the predicted and real RR contacts in one contact
	map. The results of other RR contact prediction methods can be uploaded
	as a benchmark test onto the server as well. All of these functionality
	is behind a web server, thus for using our application only a Java-capable
	web browser is needed, no further program installation is required.

	the rich compendium of precomputed data in the UCSC database. The
	Table Browser is a full-featured graphical interface, which allows
	querying, filtering and intersection of data tables. The Saved Session
	feature allows users to store and share customized views, enhancing
	the utility of the system for organizing multiple trains of thought.

  abstract = {Deluged by the rate and complexity of completed genomic sequences,
	the need to align longer sequences becomes more urgent, and many
	more tools have thus been developed. In the initial stage of genomic
	sequence analysis, a biologist is usually faced with the questions
	of how to choose the best tool to align sequences of interest and
	how to analyze and visualize the alignment results, and then with
	the question of whether poorly aligned regions produced by the tool
	are indeed not homologous or are just results due to inappropriate
	alignment tools or scoring systems used. Although several systematic
	evaluations of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) programs have been
	proposed, they may not provide a standard-bearer for most biologists
	because those poorly aligned regions in these evaluations are never
	discussed. Thus, a tool that allows cross comparison of the alignment
	results obtained by different tools simultaneously could help a biologist
	evaluate their correctness and accuracy.In this paper, we present
	a versatile alignment visualization system, called SinicView, (for
	Sequence-aligning INnovative and Interactive Comparison VIEWer),
	which allows the user to efficiently compare and evaluate assorted
	nucleotide alignment results obtained by different tools. SinicView
	calculates similarity of the alignment outputs under a fixed window
	using the sum-of-pairs method and provides scoring profiles of each
	set of aligned sequences. The user can visually compare alignment
	results either in graphic scoring profiles or in plain text format
	of the aligned nucleotides along with the annotations information.
	We illustrate the capabilities of our visualization system by comparing
	alignment results obtained by MLAGAN, MAVID, and MULTIZ, respectively.With
	SinicView, users can use their own data sequences to compare various
	alignment tools or scoring systems and select the most suitable one
	to perform alignment in the initial stage of sequence analysis.},

	Factors were used to select the best fitting model, in addition to
	Reversible Jump MCMC, which accommodated model uncertainty. A 21

	a presumed Old World origin for the genus itself, the basal lineages
	and immediate outgroups of the investigator species group are New
	World species. Bayesian methods reconstruct the common ancestor of
	the investigator species group as New World and imply one later transition

	are simultaneously working with the traditional Sanger ESTs and experimenting

	ESTs have been used to generate contigs for many years, no program
	takes full advantage of the 5' and 3' mate-pair information, hence,
	many tentative transcripts are assembled into two separate contigs.
	The new 454 technology has the benefit of high-throughput expression
	profiling, but introduces time and space problems for assembling
	large contigs.The PAVE (Program for Assembling and Viewing ESTs)
	assembler takes advantage of the 5' and 3' mate-pair information
	by requiring that the mate-pairs be assembled into the same contig
	and joined by n's if the two sub-contigs do not overlap. It handles
	the depth of 454 data sets by "burying" similar ESTs during assembly,
	which retains the expression level information while circumventing
	time and space problems. PAVE uses MegaBLAST for the clustering step
	and CAP3 for assembly, however it assembles incrementally to enforce
	the mate-pair constraint, bury ESTs, and reduce incorrect joins and
	splits. The PAVE data management system uses a MySQL database to
	store multiple libraries of ESTs along with their metadata; the management
	system allows multiple assemblies with variations on libraries and
	parameters. Analysis routines provide standard annotation for the
	contigs including a measure of differentially expressed genes across
	the libraries. A Java viewer program is provided for display and
	analysis of the results. Our results clearly show the benefit of
	using the PAVE assembler to explicitly use mate-pair information
	and bury ESTs for large contigs.The PAVE assembler provides a software
	package for assembling Sanger and/or 454 ESTs. The assembly software,
