  abstract = {It is now well established that nearly 20\% of human cancers are caused
	by infectious agents, and the list of human oncogenic pathogens will
	grow in the future for a variety of cancer types. Whole tumor transcriptome
	and genome sequencing by next-generation sequencing technologies
	presents an unparalleled opportunity for pathogen detection and discovery
	in human tissues but requires development of new genome-wide bioinformatics
	tools.Here we present CaPSID (Computational Pathogen Sequence IDentification),
	a comprehensive bioinformatics platform for identifying, querying
	and visualizing both exogenous and endogenous pathogen nucleotide
	sequences in tumor genomes and transcriptomes. CaPSID includes a
	scalable, high performance database for data storage and a web application
	that integrates the genome browser JBrowse. CaPSID also provides
	useful metrics for sequence analysis of pre-aligned BAM files, such
	as gene and genome coverage, and is optimized to run efficiently
	on multiprocessor computers with low memory usage.To demonstrate
	the usefulness and efficiency of CaPSID, we carried out a comprehensive
	analysis of both a simulated dataset and transcriptome samples from
	ovarian cancer. CaPSID correctly identified all of the human and
	pathogen sequences in the simulated dataset, while in the ovarian
	dataset CaPSID's predictions were successfully validated in vitro.},

  abstract = {Digital transcript subtraction (DTS) was developed to subtract in
	silico known human sequences from expression library data sets, leaving
	candidate nonhuman sequences for further analysis. This approach
	requires precise discrimination between human and nonhuman cDNA sequences.
	Database comparisons show high likelihood that small viral sequences
	can be successfully distinguished from human sequences. DTS analysis
	of 9,026 20-bp tags from an expression library of BCBL-1 cells infected
	with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) resolved all
	but three candidate sequences. Two of these sequences belonged to
	KSHV transcripts, and the third belonged to an unannotated human
	expression sequence tag. Overall, 0.24\% of transcripts from this
	cell line were of viral origin. DTS analysis of 241,122 expression
	tags from three squamous cell conjunctival carcinomas revealed that
	only 21 sequences did not align with sequences from human databases.
	All 21 candidates amplify human transcripts and have secondary evidence
	for being of human origin. This analysis shows that it is unlikely
	that distinguishable viral transcripts are present in conjunctival
	carcinomas at 20 transcripts per million or higher, which is the
	equivalent of approximately 4 transcripts per cell. DTS is a simple
	screening method to discover novel viral nucleic acids. It provides,
	for the first time, quantitative evidence against some classes of
	viral etiology when no viral transcripts are found, thereby reducing
	the uncertainty involved in new pathogen discovery.},
