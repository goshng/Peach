  abstract = {It is now well established that nearly 20\% of human cancers are caused
	by infectious agents, and the list of human oncogenic pathogens will
	grow in the future for a variety of cancer types. Whole tumor transcriptome
	and genome sequencing by next-generation sequencing technologies
	presents an unparalleled opportunity for pathogen detection and discovery
	in human tissues but requires development of new genome-wide bioinformatics
	tools.Here we present CaPSID (Computational Pathogen Sequence IDentification),
	a comprehensive bioinformatics platform for identifying, querying
	and visualizing both exogenous and endogenous pathogen nucleotide
	sequences in tumor genomes and transcriptomes. CaPSID includes a
	scalable, high performance database for data storage and a web application
	that integrates the genome browser JBrowse. CaPSID also provides
	useful metrics for sequence analysis of pre-aligned BAM files, such
	as gene and genome coverage, and is optimized to run efficiently
	on multiprocessor computers with low memory usage.To demonstrate
	the usefulness and efficiency of CaPSID, we carried out a comprehensive
	analysis of both a simulated dataset and transcriptome samples from
	ovarian cancer. CaPSID correctly identified all of the human and
	pathogen sequences in the simulated dataset, while in the ovarian
	dataset CaPSID's predictions were successfully validated in vitro.},
