  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Bayesian estimation of phylogeny is based on the posterior
	probability distribution of trees. Currently, the only numerical
	method that can effectively approximate posterior probabilities of
	trees is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Standard implementations
	of MCMC can be prone to entrapment in local optima. Metropolis coupled
	MCMC [(MC)(3)], a variant of MCMC, allows multiple peaks in the landscape
	of trees to be more readily explored, but at the cost of increased
	execution time. RESULTS: This paper presents a parallel algorithm
	for (MC)(3). The proposed parallel algorithm retains the ability
	to explore multiple peaks in the posterior distribution of trees
	while maintaining a fast execution time. The algorithm has been implemented
	using two popular parallel programming models: message passing and
	shared memory. Performance results indicate nearly linear speed improvement
	in both programming models for small and large data sets.},
