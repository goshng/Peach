  abstract = {A plethora of statistical models have recently been developed to estimate
	components of population genetic history. Very few of these methods,
	however, have been adequately evaluated for their performance in
	accurately estimating population genetic parameters of interest.
	In this paper, we continue a research program of evaluation of population
	genetic methods through computer simulation. Specifically, we examine
	the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and test the accuracy of this software
	to estimate genetic diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
	intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a neutral
	coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000 bp, and with three
	different per site Theta values of (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed
	with four different migration rates (0.0000025, 0.025, 0.25, 2.5)
	to construct 1000 evolutionary trees per-combination per-sequence-length.
	We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 performs reasonably well in
	estimating genetic diversity (Theta), it does poorly at estimating
	migration rates and the confidence intervals associated with them.
	We recommend researchers use this software with caution under conditions
	similar to those used in this evaluation.},

	evaluating the statistical evidence towards associating a sequence

	of our current research is to perform this task in a fast and accurate
	manner. To accomplish this we have developed a model-based, decision-theoretic
	framework based on the coalescent theory. Under this framework, we
	utilized both distance and the posterior probability of a group,
	given the sequences from members of this group and the sequence from
	a newly sampled individual to assign this new individual. We believe
	that this approach makes efficient use of the available information
	in the data. Our preliminary results indicated that this approach
	is more accurate than using a simple measure of distance for assignment.},

  abstract = {Reliable inference of ancestral sequences can be critical to identifying
	both patterns and causes of molecular evolution. Robustness of ancestral
	inference is often assumed among closely related species, but tests
	of this assumption have been limited. Here, we examine the performance
	of inference methods for data simulated under scenarios of codon
	bias evolution within the Drosophila melanogaster subgroup. Genome
	sequence data for multiple, closely related species within this subgroup
	make it an important system for studying molecular evolutionary genetics.
	The effects of asymmetric and lineage-specific substitution rates
	(i.e., varying levels of codon usage bias and departures from equilibrium)
	on the reliability of ancestral codon usage was investigated. Maximum
	parsimony inference, which has been widely employed in analyses of
	Drosophila codon bias evolution, was compared to an approach that
	attempts to account for uncertainty in ancestral inference by weighting
	ancestral reconstructions by their posterior probabilities. The latter
	approach employs maximum likelihood estimation of rate and base composition
	parameters. For equilibrium and most non-equilibrium scenarios that
	were investigated, the probabilistic method appears to generate reliable
	ancestral codon bias inferences for molecular evolutionary studies
	within the D. melanogaster subgroup. These reconstructions are more
	reliable than parsimony inference, especially when codon usage is
	strongly skewed. However, inference biases are considerable for both
	methods under particular departures from stationarity (i.e., when
	adaptive evolution is prevalent). Reliability of inference can be
	sensitive to branch lengths, asymmetry in substitution rates, and
	the locations and nature of lineage-specific processes within a gene
	tree. Inference reliability, even among closely related species,
	can be strongly affected by (potentially unknown) patterns of molecular
	evolution in lineages ancestral to those of interest.},

	cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in humans, is widely distributed in
	the Old World where different species of wild rodent and phlebotomine
	sand fly serve as animal reservoir hosts and vectors, respectively.
	Despite this, strains of L. (L.) major isolated from many different
	sources over many years have proved to be relatively uniform. To
	investigate the population structure of the species highly polymorphic
	microsatellite markers were employed for greater discrimination among
	it's otherwise closely related strains, an approach applied successfully
	to other species of Leishmania. RESULTS: Multilocus Microsatellite
	Typing (MLMT) based on 10 different microsatellite markers was applied
	to 106 strains of L. (L.) major from different regions where it is
	endemic. On applying a Bayesian model-based approach, three main
	populations were identified, corresponding to three separate geographical
	regions: Central Asia (CA); the Middle East (ME); and Africa (AF).
	This was congruent with phylogenetic reconstructions based on genetic
	distances. Re-analysis separated each of the populations into two
	sub-populations. The two African sub-populations did not correlate
	well with strains' geographical origin. Strains falling into the
	sub-populations CA and ME did mostly group according to their place
	of isolation although some anomalies were seen, probably, owing to
	human migration. CONCLUSION: The model- and distance-based analyses
	of the microsatellite data exposed three main populations of L. (L.)
	major, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa, each of which separated
	into two sub-populations. This probably correlates with the different
	species of rodent host.},

  volume = {16},
  pages = {2261--2271},

  abstract = {Indirect genetic methods are frequently used to estimate the effective
	population size (N(e)) or effective number of breeders (N(b)) in
	natural populations. Although assumptions behind these methods are
	often violated, there have been few attempts to evaluate how accurate
	these estimates really are in practice. Here we investigate the influence
	of natural selection following a population admixture on the temporal
	method for estimating N(e). Our analytical and simulation results
	suggest that N(e) is often underestimated in this method when subpopulations
	differ substantially in allele frequencies and in reproductive success.
	The underestimation is exacerbated when true N(e) and the fraction
	of the low-fitness group are large. As an empirical example, we compared
	N(b) estimated in natural populations of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus
	mykiss) using the temporal method (N(b[temp])) with estimates based
	on direct demographic methods (N(b[demo])) and the linkage disequilibrium
	method (N(b[LD])). While N(b[LD]) was generally in close agreement
	with N(b[demo]), N(b[temp]) was much lower in sample sets that were
	dominated by nonlocal hatchery fish with low reproductive success,
	as predicted by the analytical results. This bias in the temporal
	method, which arises when genes associated with a particular group
	of parents are selected against in the offspring sample, has not
	been widely appreciated before. Such situations may be particularly
	common when artificial propagation or translocations are used for
	conservation. The linkage disequilibrium method, which requires data
	from only one sample, is robust to this type of bias, although it
	can be affected by other factors.},

  volume = {8},
  pages = {458},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coalescent simulations have proven very useful in many
	population genetics studies. In order to arrive to meaningful conclusions,
	it is important that these simulations resemble the process of molecular
	evolution as much as possible. To date, no single coalescent program
	is able to simulate codon sequences sampled from populations with
	recombination, migration and growth. RESULTS: We introduce a new
	coalescent program, called Recodon, which is able to simulate samples
	of coding DNA sequences under complex scenarios in which several
	evolutionary forces can interact simultaneously (namely, recombination,
	migration and demography). The basic codon model implemented is an
	extension to the general time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution
	with a proportion of invariable sites and among-site rate variation.
	In addition, the program implements non-reversible processes and
	mixtures of different codon models. CONCLUSION: Recodon is a flexible
	tool for the simulation of coding DNA sequences under realistic evolutionary
	models. These simulations can be used to build parameter distributions
	for testing evolutionary hypotheses using experimental data. Recodon
	is written in C, can run in parallel, and is freely available from

	subdivision and natural selection on DNA polymorphism in 2 closely
	related wild tomato species (Solanum peruvianum and Solanum chilense),
	using sequence data for 8 nuclear loci from populations across much
	of the species' range. Both species exhibit substantial levels of
	nucleotide variation. The species-wide level of silent nucleotide
	diversity is 18\% higher in S. peruvianum (pi(sil) approximately
	2.50\%) than in S. chilense (pi(sil) approximately 2.12\%). One of
	the loci deviates from neutral expectations, showing a clinal pattern
	of nucleotide diversity and haplotype structure in S. chilense. This
	geographic pattern of variation is suggestive of an incomplete (ongoing)
	selective sweep, but neutral explanations cannot be entirely dismissed.
	Both wild tomato species exhibit moderate levels of population differentiation
	(average F(ST) approximately 0.20). Interestingly, the pooled samples
	(across different demes) exhibit more negative Tajima's D and Fu
	and Li's D values; this marked excess of low-frequency polymorphism
	can only be explained by population (or range) expansion and is unlikely
	to be due to population structure per se. We thus propose that population
	structure and population/range expansion are among the most important
	evolutionary forces shaping patterns of nucleotide diversity within
	and among demes in these wild tomatoes. Patterns of population differentiation
	may also be impacted by soil seed banks and historical associations
	mediated by climatic cycles. Intragenic linkage disequilibrium (LD)
	decays very rapidly with physical distance, suggesting high recombination
	rates and effective population sizes in both species. The rapid decline
	of LD seems very promising for future association studies with the

	A promising approach is to estimate parameters of simple speciation
	models using polymorphism data from multiple loci. Existing methods,
	however, make a number of assumptions that severely limit their applicability,
	notably, no gene flow after the populations split and no intralocus
	recombination. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new
	Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate parameters of an isolation-migration
	model. The approach uses summaries of polymorphism data at multiple
	loci surveyed in a pair of diverging populations or closely related
	species and, importantly, allows for intralocus recombination. To
	illustrate its potential, we applied it to extensive polymorphism
	data from populations and species of apes, whose demographic histories
	are largely unknown. The isolation-migration model appears to provide
	a reasonable fit to the data. It suggests that the two chimpanzee
	species became reproductively isolated in allopatry approximately
	850 Kya, while Western and Central chimpanzee populations split approximately
	440 Kya but continued to exchange migrants. Similarly, Eastern and
	Western gorillas and Sumatran and Bornean orangutans appear to have

	Both inference methods use the same Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm

	approach in accuracy and coverage, although for some values the two

	The program MIGRATE was extended to allow not only for ML(-) maximum

	the total number of events of compositional drift distributed across

	the coupling between speciations and compositional shifts inherent

  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modern-day proteins were selected during long evolutionary
	history as descendants of ancient life forms. In silico reconstruction
	of such ancestral protein sequences facilitates our understanding
	of evolutionary processes, protein classification and biological
	function. Additionally, reconstructed ancestral protein sequences
	could serve to fill in sequence space thus aiding remote homology
	inference. RESULTS: We developed ANCESCON, a package for distance-based
	phylogenetic inference and reconstruction of ancestral protein sequences
	that takes into account the observed variation of evolutionary rates
	between positions that more precisely describes the evolution of
	protein families. To improve the accuracy of evolutionary distance
	estimation and ancestral sequence reconstruction, two approaches
	are proposed to estimate position-specific evolutionary rates. Comparisons
	show that at large evolutionary distances our method gives more accurate
	ancestral sequence reconstruction than PAML, PHYLIP and PAUP*. We
	apply the reconstructed ancestral sequences to homology inference
	and functional site prediction. We show that the usage of hypothetical
	ancestors together with the present day sequences improves profile-based
	sequence similarity searches; and that ancestral sequence reconstruction
	methods can be used to predict positions with functional specificity.
	CONCLUSIONS: As a computational tool to reconstruct ancestral protein
	sequences from a given multiple sequence alignment, ANCESCON shows
	high accuracy in tests and helps detection of remote homologs and
	prediction of functional sites. ANCESCON is freely available for
	non-commercial use. Pre-compiled versions for several platforms can

  abstract = {Data analysis in phylogeographic investigations is typically conducted
	in either a qualitative manner, or alternatively via the testing
	of null hypotheses. The former, where inferences about population
	processes are derived from geographical patterns of genetic variation,
	may be subject to confirmation bias and prone to overinterpretation.
	Testing the predictions of null hypotheses is arguably less prone
	to bias than qualitative approaches, but only if the tested hypotheses
	are biologically meaningful. As it is difficult to know a priori
	if this is the case, there is the general need for additional methodological
	approaches in phylogeographic research. Here, we explore an alternative
	method for analysing phylogeographic data that utilizes information
	theory to quantify the probability of multiple hypotheses given the
	data. We accomplish this by augmenting the model-selection procedure
	implemented in ima with calculations of Akaike Information Criterion
	scores and model probabilities. We generate a ranking of 17 models
	each representing a set of historical evolutionary processes that
	may have contributed to the evolution of Plethodon idahoensis, and
	then quantify the relative strength of support for each hypothesis
	given the data using metrics borrowed from information theory. Our
	results suggest that two models have high probability given the data.
	Each of these models includes population divergence and estimates
	of ancestral theta that differ from estimates of descendent theta,
	inferences consistent with prior work in this system. However, the
	models disagree in that one includes migration as a parameter and
	one does not, suggesting that there are two regions of parameter
	space that produce model likelihoods that are similar in magnitude
	given our data. Results of a simulation study suggest that when data
	are simulated with migration, most of the optimal models include
	migration as a parameter, and further that when all of the shared
	polymorphism results from incomplete lineage sorting, most of the
	optimal models do not. The results could also indicate a lack of
	precision, which may be a product of the amount of data that we have
	collected. In any case, the information-theoretic metrics that we
	have applied to the analysis of our data are statistically rigorous,
	as are hypothesis-testing approaches, but move beyond the 'reject/fail
	to reject' dichotomy of conventional hypothesis testing in a manner
	that provides considerably more flexibility to researchers.},

	efficiency of estimators of null allele frequency. Further, we explored
	how the existing method for correcting genotype data for null alleles
	performed in estimating F(ST) and genetic distances, and we compared
	this method with a new method proposed here (for F(ST) only). Null
	alleles were likely to be encountered in populations with a large
	effective size, with an unusually high mutation rate in the flanking

	cloned allele state was drawn and the primers designed. When populations

	overestimated in the presence of null alleles. Frequency of null
	alleles was estimated precisely with the algorithm presented in Dempster
	et al. (1977). The conventional method for correcting genotype data
	for null alleles did not provide an accurate estimate of F(ST) and

  abstract = {The assignment of orthologous genes between a pair of genomes is a
	fundamental and challenging problem in comparative genomics. Existing
	methods that assign orthologs based on the similarity between DNA
	or protein sequences may make erroneous assignments when sequence
	similarity does not clearly delineate the evolutionary relationship
	among genes of the same families. In this paper, we present a new
	approach to ortholog assignment that takes into account both sequence
	similarity and evolutionary events at a genome level, where orthologous
	genes are assumed to correspond to each other in the most parsimonious
	evolving scenario under genome rearrangement. First, the problem
	is formulated as that of computing the signed reversal distance with
	duplicates between the two genomes of interest. Then, the problem
	is decomposed into two new optimization problems, called minimum
	common partition and maximum cycle decomposition, for which efficient
	heuristic algorithms are given. Following this approach, we have
	implemented a high-throughput system for assigning orthologs on a
	genome scale, called SOAR, and tested it on both simulated data and
	real genome sequence data. Compared to a recent ortholog assignment
	method based entirely on homology search (called INPARANOID), SOAR
	shows a marginally better performance in terms of sensitivity on
	the real data set because it is able to identify several correct
	orthologous pairs that are missed by INPARANOID. The simulation results
	demonstrate that SOAR, in general, performs better than the iterated
	exemplar algorithm in terms of computing the reversal distance and
	assigning correct orthologs.},

  abstract = {The extent to which natural selection shapes diversity within populations
	is a key question for population genetics. Thus, there is considerable
	interest in quantifying the strength of selection. A full likelihood
	approach for inference about selection at a single site within an
	otherwise neutral fully linked sequence of sites is described here.
	A coalescent model of evolution is used to model the ancestry of
	a sample of DNA sequences which have the selected site segregating.
	The mutation model, for the selected and neutral sites, is the infinitely
	many-sites model where there is no back or parallel mutation at sites.
	A unique perfect phylogeny, a gene tree, can be constructed from
	the configuration of mutations on the sample sequences under this
	model of mutation. The approach is general and can be used for any
	bi-allelic selection scheme. Selection is incorporated through modelling
	the frequency of the selected and neutral allelic classes stochastically
	back in time, then using a subdivided population model considering
	the population frequencies through time as variable population sizes.
	An importance sampling algorithm is then used to explore over coalescent
	tree space consistent with the data. The method is applied to a simulated
	data set and the gene tree presented in Verrelli et al. (2002).},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},

  volume = {9},
  pages = {539},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the most recent decade many Bayesian statistical
	models and software for answering questions related to the genetic
	structure underlying population samples have appeared in the scientific
	literature. Most of these methods utilize molecular markers for the
	inferences, while some are also capable of handling DNA sequence
	data. In a number of earlier works, we have introduced an array of
	statistical methods for population genetic inference that are implemented
	in the software BAPS. However, the complexity of biological problems
	related to genetic structure analysis keeps increasing such that
	in many cases the current methods may provide either inappropriate
	or insufficient solutions. RESULTS: We discuss the necessity of enhancing
	the statistical approaches to face the challenges posed by the ever-increasing
	amounts of molecular data generated by scientists over a wide range
	of research areas and introduce an array of new statistical tools
	implemented in the most recent version of BAPS. With these methods
	it is possible, e.g., to fit genetic mixture models using user-specified
	numbers of clusters and to estimate levels of admixture under a genetic
	linkage model. Also, alleles representing a different ancestry compared
	to the average observed genomic positions can be tracked for the
	sampled individuals, and a priori specified hypotheses about genetic
	population structure can be directly compared using Bayes' theorem.
	In general, we have improved further the computational characteristics
	of the algorithms behind the methods implemented in BAPS facilitating
	the analyses of large and complex datasets. In particular, analysis
	of a single dataset can now be spread over multiple computers using
	a script interface to the software. CONCLUSION: The Bayesian modelling
	methods introduced in this article represent an array of enhanced
	tools for learning the genetic structure of populations. Their implementations
	in the BAPS software are designed to meet the increasing need for
	analyzing large-scale population genetics data. The software is freely

  abstract = {We present likelihood-based methods for assigning the individuals
	in a sample to source populations, on the basis of their genotypes
	at co-dominant marker loci. The source populations are assumed to
	be at Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium, but the allelic composition
	of these source populations and even the number of source populations
	represented in the sample are treated as uncertain. The parameter
	of interest is the partition of the set of sampled individuals, induced
	by the assignment of individuals to source populations. We present
	a maximum likelihood method, and then a more powerful Bayesian approach
	for estimating this sample partition. In general, it will not be
	feasible to evaluate the evidence supporting each possible partition
	of the sample. Furthermore, when the number of individuals in the
	sample is large, it may not even be feasible to evaluate the evidence
	supporting, individually, each of the most plausible partitions because
	there may be many individuals which are difficult to assign. To overcome
	these problems, we use low-dimensional marginals (the 'co-assignment
	probabilities') of the posterior distribution of the sample partition
	as measures of 'similarity', and then apply a hierarchical clustering
	algorithm to identify clusters of individuals whose assignment together
	is well supported by the posterior distribution. A binary tree provides
	a visual representation of how well the posterior distribution supports
	each cluster in the hierarchy. These methods are applicable to other
	problems where the parameter of interest is a partition of a set.
	Because the co-assignment probabilities are independent of the arbitrary
	labelling of source populations, we avoid the label-switching problem
	of previous Bayesian methods.},

	Our approach is purely sequence based, and does not rely on gene
	identification. We show how inference can be performed under our
	model and illustrate its use on three datasets from Francisella tularensis,
	Streptococcus pyogenes, and Escherichia coli. In all three examples,
	we found interesting variations in the rates of genetic material
	gain and loss, which strongly correlate with their lifestyle. The

  volume = {5},
  pages = {123},
  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prediction of ancestral protein sequences from multiple
	sequence alignments is useful for many bioinformatics analyses. Predicting
	ancestral sequences is not a simple procedure and relies on accurate
	alignments and phylogenies. Several algorithms exist based on Maximum
	Parsimony or Maximum Likelihood methods but many current implementations
	are unable to process residues with gaps, which may represent insertion/deletion
	(indel) events or sequence fragments. RESULTS: Here we present a
	new algorithm, GASP (Gapped Ancestral Sequence Prediction), for predicting
	ancestral sequences from phylogenetic trees and the corresponding
	multiple sequence alignments. Alignments may be of any size and contain
	gaps. GASP first assigns the positions of gaps in the phylogeny before
	using a likelihood-based approach centred on amino acid substitution
	matrices to assign ancestral amino acids. Important outgroup information
	is used by first working down from the tips of the tree to the root,
	using descendant data only to assign probabilities, and then working
	back up from the root to the tips using descendant and outgroup data
	to make predictions. GASP was tested on a number of simulated datasets
	based on real phylogenies. Prediction accuracy for ungapped data
	was similar to three alternative algorithms tested, with GASP performing
	better in some cases and worse in others. Adding simple insertions
	and deletions to the simulated data did not have a detrimental effect
	on GASP accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: GASP (Gapped Ancestral Sequence Prediction)
	will predict ancestral sequences from multiple protein alignments
	of any size. Although not as accurate in all cases as some of the
	more sophisticated maximum likelihood approaches, it can process
	a wide range of input phylogenies and will predict ancestral sequences
	for gapped and ungapped residues alike.},

	trees are embedded are of primary interest. We analyze a Bayesian
	model for estimating species trees that accounts for the stochastic
	variation expected for gene trees from multiple unlinked loci sampled
	from a single species history after a coalescent process. Application
	of the model to a 106-gene data set from yeast shows that the set
	of gene trees recovered by statistically acknowledging the shared
	but unknown species tree from which gene trees are sampled is much
	reduced compared with treating the history of each locus independently
	of an overarching species tree. The analysis also yields a concentrated
	posterior distribution of the yeast species tree whose mode is congruent
	with the concatenated gene tree but can do so with less than half
	the loci required by the concatenation method. Using simulations,
	we show that, with large numbers of loci, highly resolved species
	trees can be estimated under conditions in which concatenation of
	sequence data will positively mislead phylogeny, and when the proportion
	of gene trees matching the species tree is <10\%. However, when gene
	tree/species tree congruence is high, species trees can be resolved
	with just two or three loci. These results make accessible an alternative

  abstract = {We introduce here a Bayesian analysis of a classical admixture model
	in which all parameters are simultaneously estimated. Our approach
	follows the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework, relying
	on massive simulations and a rejection-regression algorithm. Although
	computationally intensive, this approach can easily deal with complex
	mutation models and partially linked loci, and it can be thoroughly
	validated without much additional computation cost. Compared to a
	recent maximum-likelihood (ML) method, the ABC approach leads to
	similarly accurate estimates of admixture proportions in the case
	of recent admixture events, but it is found superior when the admixture
	is more ancient. All other parameters of the admixture model such
	as the divergence time between parental populations, the admixture
	time, and the population sizes are also well estimated, unlike the
	ML method. The use of partially linked markers does not introduce
	any particular bias in the estimation of admixture, but ML confidence
	intervals are found too narrow if linkage is not specifically accounted
	for. The application of our method to an artificially admixed domestic
	bee population from northwest Italy suggests that the admixture occurred
	in the last 10-40 generations and that the parental Apis mellifera
	and A. ligustica populations were completely separated since the
	last glacial maximum.},

	to understand our own history, but it is necessary to disentangle
	the effects of demography and selection on genome diversity. Although
	most genetic data support the view that our species originated recently
	in Africa, it is still unclear if it completely replaced former members
	of the Homo genus, or if some interbreeding occurred during its range
	expansion. Several scenarios of modern human evolution have been
	proposed on the basis of molecular and paleontological data, but
	their likelihood has never been statistically assessed. Using DNA
	data from 50 nuclear loci sequenced in African, Asian and Native
	American samples, we show here by extensive simulations that a simple
	African replacement model with exponential growth has a higher probability
	(78\%) as compared with alternative multiregional evolution or assimilation
	scenarios. A Bayesian analysis of the data under this best supported
	model points to an origin of our species approximately 141 thousand
	years ago (Kya), an exit out-of-Africa approximately 51 Kya, and
	a recent colonization of the Americas approximately 10.5 Kya. We
	also find that the African replacement model explains not only the
	shallow ancestry of mtDNA or Y-chromosomes but also the occurrence
	of deep lineages at some autosomal loci, which has been formerly
	interpreted as a sign of interbreeding with Homo erectus.},

	formula developed by Fu and Li, who used optimistic assumptions.
	Their formulas are restated in terms of accuracy, defined here as
	the reciprocal of the squared coefficient of variation. This should
	be proportional to sample size when the entities sampled provide
	independent information. Using these formulas for accuracy, the sampling
	strategy for estimation of Theta can be investigated. Two models
	for cost have been used, a cost-per-base model and a cost-per-read
	model. The former would lead us to prefer to have a very large number
	of loci, each one base long. The latter, which is more realistic,
	causes us to prefer to have one read per locus and an optimum sample
	size which declines as costs of sampling organisms increase. For
	realistic values, the optimum sample size is 8 or fewer individuals.
	This is quite close to the results obtained by Pluzhnikov and Donnelly
	for a cost-per-base model, evaluating other estimators of Theta.
	It can be understood by considering that the resources spent collecting
	larger samples prevent us from considering more loci. An examination
	of the efficiency of Watterson's estimator of Theta was also made,
	and it was found to be reasonably efficient when the number of mutants
	per generation in the sequence in the whole population is less than

	rates, the product 4N(e) mu of mutation rate per site and effective
	population size. To compute the likelihood for a sample of unrecombined
	nucleotide sequences taken from a random-mating population it is
	necessary to sum over all genealogies that could have led to the
	sequences, computing for each one the probability that it would have
	yielded the sequences, and weighting each one by its prior probability.
	The genealogies vary in tree topology and in branch lengths. Although
	the likelihood and the prior are straightforward to compute, the
	summation over all genealogies seems at first sight hopelessly difficult.
	This paper reports that it is possible to carry out a Monte Carlo
	integration to evaluate the likelihoods approximately. The method
	uses bootstrap sampling of sites to create data sets for each of
	which a maximum likelihood tree is estimated. The resulting trees
	are assumed to be sampled from a distribution whose height is proportional
	to the likelihood surface for the full data. That it will be so is
	dependent on a theorem which is not proven, but seems likely to be
	true if the sequences are not short. One can use the resulting estimated
	likelihood curve to make a maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter
	of interest, N(e) or of 4N(e) mu. The method requires at least 100
	times the computational effort required for estimation of a phylogeny
	by maximum likelihood, but is practical on today's work stations.
	The method does not at present have any way of dealing with recombination.},

  abstract = {The method of Hidden Markov Models is used to allow for unequal and
	unknown evolutionary rates at different sites in molecular sequences.
	Rates of evolution at different sites are assumed to be drawn from
	a set of possible rates, with a finite number of possibilities. The
	overall likelihood of phylogeny is calculated as a sum of terms,
	each term being the probability of the data given a particular assignment
	of rates to sites, times the prior probability of that particular
	combination of rates. The probabilities of different rate combinations
	are specified by a stationary Markov chain that assigns rate categories
	to sites. While there will be a very large number of possible ways
	of assigning rates to sites, a simple recursive algorithm allows
	the contributions to the likelihood from all possible combinations
	of rates to be summed, in a time proportional to the number of different
	rates at a single site. Thus with three rates, the effort involved
	is no greater than three times that for a single rate. This "Hidden
	Markov Model" method allows for rates to differ between sites and
	for correlations between the rates of neighboring sites. By summing
	over all possibilities it does not require us to know the rates at
	individual sites. However, it does not allow for correlation of rates
	at nonadjacent sites, nor does it allow for a continuous distribution
	of rates over sites. It is shown how to use the Newton-Raphson method
	to estimate branch lengths of a phylogeny and to infer from a phylogeny
	what assignment of rates to sites has the largest posterior probability.
	An example is given using beta-hemoglobin DNA sequences in eight
	mammal species; the regions of high and low evolutionary rates are
	inferred and also the average length of patches of similar rates.},

	was almost entirely due to a difference between flounder that have
	demersal spawning in the northern Baltic, as compared to pelagic
	spawners in the southern Baltic and on the west coast of Sweden.
	Among demersal spawners we found neither genetic differentiation
	nor any isolation by distance among sampling sites. We speculate
	that demersal flounder are descendants of a population that colonized
	the Baltic previous to pelagic spawners. The demersal flounder may
	thus have had longer time to adapt to the low salinity in the Baltic,
	and accordingly display egg characteristics that make it possible
	to reproduce at the low salinity levels in the northern Baltic. Among
	pelagic spawners significant isolation by distance was detected.
	Pelagic spawners have previously been shown to display clinal variation
	in egg size, which allows them to float also at the moderate salinity
	levels up to the region north of the island Bornholm. Management
	units for harvesting should ideally be based on true biological populations,
	and for the commercially important flounder up to 15 different management
	stocks in the Baltic have been suggested. We could not find a population
	genetic foundation for such a high number of management units, and
	our data suggest three management units: the northern Baltic (demersal
	populations), southern Baltic with the Oresund straits and the most
	northwestern sampling sites (Skagerrak, Kattegat and North Sea).},

	taxonomic unit (MOTU) scheme for soil nematodes. Individual specimens
	were considered to belong to the same MOTU when the sequenced segment
	of 450 bases was > 99.5\% identical. A Scottish upland Agrostis-Festuca
	grassland soil was sampled, using both culture-based and random selection
	methods. One hundred and sixty-six cultured isolates were sequenced,
	and clustered into five MOTU. From 74 randomly sampled individuals
	across the study site, 19 MOTU were defined. A subsequent sample
	of 18 individuals from a single subplot contained eight MOTU, four
	of which were unique to the single subplot sample. Interestingly,
	seven of these MOTU were not present in the culture-independent sampling.
	Overall, a total of 23 MOTU were defined from only 240 sequences.
	Many MOTU could readily be assigned to classical, morphologically
	defined taxonomic units using a database of SSU sequences from named
	nematode species. The MOTU technique allows a rapid assessment of
	nematode taxon diversity in soils. Correlation with a database of
	sequences from known species offers a route to application of the

  journal = {BMC Genet},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Time-structured genetic samples are a valuable source
	of information in population genetics because they provide several
	correlated observations of the underlying evolutionary processes.
	In this paper we study basic properties of the genetic variation
	in time-structured samples as reflected in the genealogies relating
	individuals and the number of segregating sites observed. Our emphasis
	is on "measurably evolving populations" i.e. populations from which
	it is possible to obtain time-structured samples that span a significant
	interval of evolutionary time. RESULTS: We use results from the coalescent
	process to derive properties of time-structured samples. In the first
	section we extend existing results to attain measures on coalescent
	trees relating time-structured samples. These include the expected
	time to a most recent common ancestor, the expected total branch
	length and the expected length of branches subtending only ancient
	individuals. The effect of different sampling schemes on the latter
	measure is studied. In the second section we study the special case
	where the full sample consists of a group of contemporary extant
	samples and a group of contemporary ancient samples. As regards this
	case, we present results and applications concerning the probability
	distribution of the number of segregating sites where a mutation
	is unique to the ancient individuals and the number of segregating
	sites where a mutation is shared between ancient and extant individuals.
	CONCLUSION: The methodology and results presented here is of use
	to the design and interpretation of ancient DNA experiments. Furthermore,
	the results may be useful in further development of statistical tests
	of e.g. population dynamics and selection, which include temporal
	information.},

  abstract = {Minisatellite and microsatellite are short tandemly repetitive sequences
	dispersed in eukaryotic genomes, many of which are highly polymorphic
	due to copy number variation of the repeats. Because mutation changes
	copy numbers of the repeat sequences in a generalized stepwise fashion,
	stepwise mutation models are widely used for studying the dynamics
	of these loci. We propose a minimum chi-square (MCS) method for simultaneous
	estimation of all the parameters in a stepwise mutation model and
	the ancestral allelic type of a sample. The MCS estimator requires
	knowing the mean number of alleles of a certain size in a sample,
	which can be estimated using Monte Carlo samples generated by a coalescent
	algorithm. The method is applied to samples of seven (CA)n repeat
	loci from eight human populations and one chimpanzee population.
	The estimated values of parameters suggest that there is a general
	tendency for microsatellite alleles to expand in size, because (1)
	each mutation has a slight tendency to cause size increase and (2)
	the mean size increase is larger than the mean size decrease for
	a mutation. Our estimates also suggest that most of these CA-repeat
	loci evolve according to multistep mutation models rather than single-step
	mutation models. We also introduced several quantities for measuring
	the quality of the estimation of ancestral allelic type, and it appears
	that the majority of the estimated ancestral allelic types are reasonably
	accurate. Implications of our analysis and potential extensions of
	the method are discussed.SINCE the discovery that a large number
	of loci with tandemly repeated sequences in human and many eukaryote
	species are highly polymorphic because of copy number variation of
	the repeats in different individuals (Jeffreys 1985; Litt and Luty
	1989; Weber and May 1989), allele size data from such loci are rapidly
	becoming the dominant source of genetic markers for genome mapping,
	forensic testing, and population studies. Loci with repeat sequences
	longer than 5 bp are generally referred to as minisatellite or variable
	number tandem repeat loci, and those with repeat sequences between
	2 to 5 bp are referred to as microsatellite or short tandem repeat
	loci (Tautz 1993). Because mutations change the copy number of such
	loci in a stepwise fashion, rapid accumulation of population samples
	from minisatellite and microsatellite loci has resurrected the interest
	of the stepwise mutation model (SMM), which was popular in the 1970s.},

	considerable interest to quantify the contribution of two forms of
	nonrandom mating to patterns of standing genetic variation: inbreeding
	(mating among relatives) and population substructure (limited dispersal
	of gametes). Here, we extend the popular Bayesian clustering approach
	STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al. 2000) for simultaneous inference of inbreeding
	or selfing rates and population-of-origin classification using multilocus
	genetic markers. This is accomplished by eliminating the assumption
	of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within clusters and, instead, calculating
	expected genotype frequencies on the basis of inbreeding or selfing
	rates. We demonstrate the need for such an extension by showing that
	selfing leads to spurious signals of population substructure using
	the standard STRUCTURE algorithm with a bias toward spurious signals
	of admixture. We gauge the performance of our method using extensive
	coalescent simulations and demonstrate that our approach can correct
	for this bias. We also apply our approach to understanding the population
	structure of the wild relative of domesticated rice, Oryza rufipogon,
	an important partially selfing grass species. Using a sample of n

	and divergence at loci on the autosomes, X chromosome, Y chromosome
	and mitochondrial DNA in samples of Mus domesticus, M. musculus and
	M. castaneus. We analyzed our data under a divergence with gene flow
	model and estimate that the effective population size of M. castaneus
	is 200,000-400,000, of M. domesticus is 100,000-200,000 and of M.
	musculus is 60,000-120,000. These data also suggest that these species
	started to diverge approximately 500,000 years ago. Consistent with
	this recent divergence, we observed considerable variation in the
	genealogical patterns among loci. For some loci, all alleles within
	each species formed a monophyletic group, while at other loci, species
	were intermingled on the phylogeny of alleles. This intermingling
	probably reflects both incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow after
	divergence. Likelihood ratio tests rejected a strict allopatric model
	with no gene flow in comparisons between each pair of species. Gene
	flow was asymmetric: no gene flow was detected into M. domesticus,
	while significant gene flow was detected into both M. castaneus and
	M. musculus. Finally, most of the gene flow occurred at autosomal
	loci, resulting in a significantly higher ratio of fixed differences
	to polymorphisms at the X and Y chromosomes relative to autosomes
	in some comparisons, or just the X chromosome in others, emphasizing
	the important role of the sex chromosomes in general and the X chromosome
	in particular in speciation.},

	However, inference about population processes relies on the specification

	the mutation process at 14 tetranucleotide repeats and carry out
	an advanced multilocus analysis of different demographic scenarios

	assumptions about the mutation process, which is more powerful to
	detect departures from the null hypothesis of constant population
	size than other methods previously applied to similar data sets.
	We detect a signal of population expansion in all samples examined,
	except for one African sample. As part of this analysis, we identify
	an "anomalous" locus whose extreme pattern of variation cannot be
	explained by variability in mutation size. Exaggerated mutation rate
	is proposed as a possible cause for its unusual variation pattern.
	We evaluate the effect of using it to infer population histories
	and show that inferences about demographic histories are markedly
	affected by its inclusion. In fact, exclusion of the anomalous locus
	reduces interlocus variability of statistics summarizing population
	variation and strengthens the evidence in favor of demographic growth.},

  pages = {252},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large pelagic fishes are generally thought to have little
	population genetic structuring based on their cosmopolitan distribution,
	large population sizes and high dispersal capacities. However, gene
	flow can be influenced by ecological (e.g. homing behaviour) and
	physical (e.g. present-day ocean currents, past changes in sea temperature
	and levels) factors. In this regard, Atlantic bigeye tuna shows an
	interesting genetic structuring pattern with two highly divergent
	mitochondrial clades (Clades I and II), which are assumed to have
	been originated during the last Pleistocene glacial maxima. We assess
	genetic structure patterns of Atlantic bigeye tuna at the nuclear
	level, and compare them with mitochondrial evidence. RESULTS: We
	examined allele size variation of nine microsatellite loci in 380
	individuals from the Gulf of Guinea, Canary, Azores, Canada, Indian
	Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. To investigate temporal stability of genetic
	structure, three Atlantic Ocean sites were re-sampled a second year.
	Hierarchical AMOVA tests, RST pairwise comparisons, isolation by
	distance (Mantel) tests, Bayesian clustering analyses, and coalescence-based
	migration rate inferences supported unrestricted gene flow within
	the Atlantic Ocean at the nuclear level, and therefore interbreeding
	between individuals belonging to both mitochondrial clades. Moreover,
	departures from HWE in several loci were inferred for the samples
	of Guinea, and attributed to a Wahlund effect supporting the role
	of this region as a spawning and nursery area. Our microsatellite
	data supported a single worldwide panmictic unit for bigeye tunas.
	Despite the strong Agulhas Current, immigration rates seem to be
	higher from the Atlantic Ocean into the Indo-Pacific Ocean, but the
	actual number of individuals moving per generation is relatively
	low compared to the large population sizes inhabiting each ocean
	basin. CONCLUSION: Lack of congruence between mt and nuclear evidences,
	which is also found in other species, most likely reflects past events
	of isolation and secondary contact. Given the inferred relatively
	low number of immigrants per generation around the Cape of Good Hope,
	the proportions of the mitochondrial clades in the different oceans
	may keep stable, and it seems plausible that the presence of individuals
	belonging to the mt Clade I in the Atlantic Ocean may be due to extensive
	migrations that predated the last glaciation.},

	This can circumvent the calculation of p values and the statistical

	for the chi(2) statistic (with and without continuity correction)
	in terms of the heterozygote frequency an acceptance region for Hardy-Weinberg
	equilibrium is obtained that can be depicted in a ternary plot. RESULTS:
	We obtain equations for curves in the ternary plot that separate
	markers that are out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium from those that
	are in equilibrium. The curves depend on the chosen significance
	level, the sample size and on a continuity correction parameter.
	Some examples of graphical tests using a set of 106 SNPs on the long
	arm of human chromosome 22 are described. Significant markers and
	poor markers with a lot of missing values are easily identified in

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: This article considers the problem of estimating population
	genetic subdivision from multilocus genotype data. A model is considered
	to make use of genotypes and possibly of spatial coordinates of sampled
	individuals. A particular attention is paid to the case of low genetic
	differentiation with the help of a previously described Bayesian
	clustering model where allele frequencies are assumed to be a priori
	correlated. Under this model, various problems of inference are considered,
	in particular the common and difficult, but still unaddressed, situation
	where the number of populations is unknown. RESULTS: A Markov chain
	Monte Carlo algorithm and a new post-processing scheme are proposed.
	It is shown that they significantly improve the accuracy of previously
	existing algorithms in terms of estimated number of populations and
	estimated population membership. This is illustrated numerically
	with data simulated from the prior-likelihood model used in inference
	and also with data simulated from a Wright-Fisher model. Improvements
	are also illustrated on a real dataset of eighty-eight wolverines
	(Gulo gulo) genotyped at 10 microsatellites loci. The interest of
	the solutions presented here are not specific to any clustering model
	and are hence relevant to many settings in populations genetics where
	weakly differentiated populations are assumed or sought. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {Landscape genetics is a new discipline that aims to provide information
	on how landscape and environmental features influence population
	genetic structure. The first key step of landscape genetics is the
	spatial detection and location of genetic discontinuities between
	populations. However, efficient methods for achieving this task are
	lacking. In this article, we first clarify what is conceptually involved
	in the spatial modeling of genetic data. Then we describe a Bayesian
	model implemented in a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme that allows
	inference of the location of such genetic discontinuities from individual
	geo-referenced multilocus genotypes, without a priori knowledge on
	populational units and limits. In this method, the global set of
	sampled individuals is modeled as a spatial mixture of panmictic
	populations, and the spatial organization of populations is modeled
	through the colored Voronoi tessellation. In addition to spatially
	locating genetic discontinuities, the method quantifies the amount
	of spatial dependence in the data set, estimates the number of populations
	in the studied area, assigns individuals to their population of origin,
	and detects individual migrants between populations, while taking
	into account uncertainty on the location of sampled individuals.
	The performance of the method is evaluated through the analysis of
	simulated data sets. Results show good performances for standard
	data sets (e.g., 100 individuals genotyped at 10 loci with 10 alleles
	per locus), with high but also low levels of population differentiation
	(e.g., FST<0.05). The method is then applied to a set of 88 individuals
	of wolverines (Gulo gulo) sampled in the northwestern United States
	and genotyped at 10 microsatellites.},

	DNA (mtDNA) was calibrated by setting the date of divergence between
	primates and ungulates at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (65 million
	years ago), when the extinction of dinosaurs occurred. A generalized
	least-squares method was applied in fitting a model to mtDNA sequence
	data, and the clock gave dates of 92.3 +/- 11.7, 13.3 +/- 1.5, 10.9
	+/- 1.2, 3.7 +/- 0.6, and 2.7 +/- 0.6 million years ago (where the
	second of each pair of numbers is the standard deviation) for the
	separation of mouse, gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee,
	respectively, from the line leading to humans. Although there is
	some uncertainty in the clock, this dating may pose a problem for
	the widely believed hypothesis that the pipedal creature Australopithecus
	afarensis, which lived some 3.7 million years ago at Laetoli in Tanzania
	and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was ancestral to man and evolved after
	the human-ape splitting. Another likelier possibility is that mtDNA
	was transferred through hybridization between a proto-human and a
	proto-chimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective population size (Ne) is related to genetic variability
	and is a basic parameter in many models of population genetics. A
	number of methods for inferring current and past population sizes
	from genetic data have been developed since JFC Kingman introduced
	the n-coalescent in 1982. Here we present the Extended Bayesian Skyline
	Plot, a non-parametric Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm
	that extends a previous coalescent-based method in several ways,
	including the ability to analyze multiple loci. RESULTS: Through
	extensive simulations we show the accuracy and limitations of inferring
	population size as a function of the amount of data, including recovering
	information about evolutionary bottlenecks. We also analyzed two
	real data sets to demonstrate the behavior of the new method; a single
	gene Hepatitis C virus data set sampled from Egypt and a 10 locus
	Drosophila ananassae data set representing 16 different populations.
	CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the essential role of multiple
	loci in recovering population size dynamics. Multi-locus data from
	a small number of individuals can precisely recover past bottlenecks
	in population size which can not be characterized by analysis of
	a single locus. We also demonstrate that sequence data quality is
	important because even moderate levels of sequencing errors result
	in a considerable decrease in estimation accuracy for realistic levels

	achieve high statistical power for rejecting simultaneous vicariance,
	given a reasonable number of intron loci (> 5 loci, 400 bp) and a

	barrier, leading to the conclusion that isolation was nonsynchronous.
	However, only rarely do researchers account for the expected variance
	associated with ancestral coalescence and among-taxon variation in
	demographic history. We introduce a flexible approximate Bayesian
	computational (ABC) framework that can test for simultaneous divergence
	(TSD) using a hierarchical model that incorporates idiosyncratic
	differences in demographic history across taxon pairs. The method
	is tested across a range of conditions and is shown to be accurate
	even with single-locus mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data. We apply this
	method to a landmark dataset of putative simultaneous vicariance,
	eight geminate echinoid taxon pairs thought to have been split by
	the Isthmus of Panama 3.1 million years ago. The ABC posterior estimates
	are not consistent with a history of simultaneous vicariance given
	these data. Subsequent ABC estimates under a constrained model that
	assumes two divergence times across the eight taxon pairs suggests
	simultaneous divergence 3.1 million years ago in seven of the taxon
	pairs and a more recent divergence in the remaining taxon pair. These
	ABC estimates on the simultaneous divergence of the seven taxon pairs
	correspond to a DNA substitution rate of approximately 1.59\% per
	lineage per million years at the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I gene.
	This ABC framework can easily be modified to analyze single taxon-pair
	datasets and/or be expanded to include multiple loci, migration,
	recombination, and other idiosyncratic demographic histories. The
	flexible aspect of ABC and its built-in evaluation of estimator bias
	and statistical power has the potential to greatly enhance statistical

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {268},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although testing for simultaneous divergence (vicariance)
	across different population-pairs that span the same barrier to gene
	flow is of central importance to evolutionary biology, researchers
	often equate the gene tree and population/species tree thereby ignoring
	stochastic coalescent variance in their conclusions of temporal incongruence.
	In contrast to other available phylogeographic software packages,
	msBayes is the only one that analyses data from multiple species/population
	pairs under a hierarchical model. RESULTS: msBayes employs approximate
	Bayesian computation (ABC) under a hierarchical coalescent model
	to test for simultaneous divergence (TSD) in multiple co-distributed
	population-pairs. Simultaneous isolation is tested by estimating
	three hyper-parameters that characterize the degree of variability
	in divergence times across co-distributed population pairs while
	allowing for variation in various within population-pair demographic
	parameters (sub-parameters) that can affect the coalescent. msBayes
	is a software package consisting of several C and R programs that
	are run with a Perl "front-end". CONCLUSION: The method reasonably
	distinguishes simultaneous isolation from temporal incongruence in
	the divergence of co-distributed population pairs, even with sparse
	sampling of individuals. Because the estimate step is decoupled from
	the simulation step, one can rapidly evaluate different ABC acceptance/rejection
	conditions and the choice of summary statistics. Given the complex
	and idiosyncratic nature of testing multi-species biogeographic hypotheses,
	we envision msBayes as a powerful and flexible tool for tackling
	a wide array of difficult research questions that use population
	genetic data from multiple co-distributed species. The msBayes pipeline
	is available for download at http://msbayes.sourceforge.net/ under
	an open source license (GNU Public License). The msBayes pipeline
	is comprised of several C and R programs that are run with a Perl
	"front-end" and runs on Linux, Mac OS-X, and most POSIX systems.
	Although the current implementation is for a single locus per species-pair,
	future implementations will allow analysis of multi-loci data per
	species pair.},

	populations and the number of populations have both been considered
	random variables that follow a Dirichlet process prior. We examined
	the statistical behavior of assignment of individuals to populations
	under a Dirichlet process prior. First, we examined a best-case scenario,
	in which all of the assumptions of the Dirichlet process prior were
	satisfied, by generating data under a Dirichlet process prior. Second,
	we examined the performance of the method when the genetic data were
	generated under a population genetics model with symmetric migration
	between populations. We examined the accuracy of population assignment
	using a distance on partitions. The method can be quite accurate
	with a moderate number of loci. As expected, inferences on the number
	of populations are more accurate when theta = 4N(e)u is large and
	when the migration rate (4N(e)m) is low. We also examined the sensitivity
	of inferences of population structure to choice of the parameter
	of the Dirichlet process model. Although inferences could be sensitive
	to the choice of the prior on the number of populations, this sensitivity
	occurred when the number of loci sampled was small; inferences are
	more robust to the prior on the number of populations when the number
	of sampled loci is large. Finally, we discuss several methods for
	summarizing the results of a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
	analysis of population structure. We develop the notion of the mean
	population partition, which is the partition of individuals to populations
	that minimizes the squared partition distance to the partitions sampled

  abstract = {A common problem in molecular phylogenetics is choosing a model of

	methods have been used to choose among a small set of candidate substitution
	models, such as the likelihood ratio test, the Akaike Information
	Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Bayes
	factors. Current implementations of any of these criteria suffer
	from the limitation that only a small set of models are examined,
	or that the test does not allow easy comparison of non-nested models.
	In this article, we expand the pool of candidate substitution models
	to include all possible time-reversible models. This set includes
	seven models that have already been described. We show how Bayes
	factors can be calculated for these models using reversible jump
	Markov chain Monte Carlo, and apply the method to 16 DNA sequence
	alignments. For each data set, we compare the model with the best
	Bayes factor to the best models chosen using AIC and BIC. We find

	the most complicated one; models with an intermediate number of substitution
	types typically do best. Moreover, almost all of the models that

	rate bias that plays the largest role in determining which models
	are selected. Importantly, the reversible jump Markov chain Monte

  abstract = {The Pleistocene was characterized by a cyclic pattern of cold and
	warm climatic periods, or climatic oscillations, which caused fluctuations
	in the distributions of organisms. This resulted in drastic changes

	Phylogeographic studies have elucidated the history of populations
	during the Pleistocene. However, given the lack of model-based analysis
	of population histories, previous phylogeographic studies could not
	adequately evaluate the effect of these Pleistocene climatic oscillations
	on the genetic divergence and migration events between populations.
	Populations of Japanese alpine plants in central and northern Japan
	are highly differentiated, and a history of isolation between regions
	during the Pleistocene was inferred. Using sequences of ten nuclear
	genes (approximately 7,000 bp in total) from Cardamine nipponica

	to test the significance of the isolation history between central

	Pleistocene climatic oscillations were involved in the genetic differentiation

	two regions were separated about 100,000-110,000 years ago. The exclusive
	occurrence of closely related haplotypes within each region (parsimony

	following the isolation of the two regions. Therefore, the genetic
	differentiation between regions was shaped during the Pleistocene,
	especially during the last glacial and inter- and post-glacial periods.
	In addition, our multilocus analysis showed that populations in central
	and northern Japan were completely isolated after they split. Geographic
	separation and subsequent restricted migration events among mountains
	could explain this isolation history between regions. Furthermore,
	genetic drift in the reduced populations would remove evidence of
	occasional migration, emphasizing the isolation history. Therefore,
	our application of a demographic model demonstrated the Pleistocene
	origin of geographic differentiation statistically and provided a
	plausible migration history for C. nipponica.},

	In population-genetic clustering algorithms, such as BAPS, STRUCTURE

	set of clusters, often using unsupervised approaches that involve
	stochastic simulation. As a result, replicate cluster analyses of
	the same data may produce several distinct solutions for estimated
	cluster membership coefficients, even though the same initial conditions

	analysis are labeled, and (2) 'genuine multimodality,' truly distinct
	solutions across replicates. RESULTS: To facilitate the interpretation
	of population-genetic clustering results, we describe three algorithms
	for aligning multiple replicate analyses of the same data set. We
	have implemented these algorithms in the computer program CLUMPP

	between 11 pre-defined Chinese ethnic/regional populations, using
	5 microsatellite markers from the non-recombining region of the Y-chromosome

  abstract = {Patterns of genetic variation can provide valuable insights for deciphering
	the relative roles of different evolutionary processes in species
	differentiation. However, population-genetic models for studying
	divergence in geographically structured species are generally lacking.
	Since these are the biogeographic settings where genetic drift is
	expected to predominate, not only are population-genetic tests of
	hypotheses in geographically structured species constrained, but
	generalizations about the evolutionary processes that promote species
	divergence may also be potentially biased. Here we estimate a population-divergence
	model in montane grasshoppers from the sky islands of the Rocky Mountains.
	Because this region was directly impacted by Pleistocene glaciation,
	both the displacement into glacial refugia and recolonization of
	montane habitats may contribute to differentiation. Building on the
	tradition of using information from the genealogical relationships
	of alleles to infer the geography of divergence, here the additional
	consideration of the process of gene-lineage sorting is used to obtain
	a quantitative estimate of population relationships and historical
	associations (i.e., a population tree) from the gene trees of five
	anonymous nuclear loci and one mitochondrial locus in the broadly
	distributed species Melanoplus oregonensis. Three different approaches
	are used to estimate a model of population divergence; this comparison
	allows us to evaluate specific methodological assumptions that influence
	the estimated history of divergence. A model of population divergence
	was identified that significantly fits the data better compared to
	the other approaches, based on per-site likelihood scores of the
	multiple loci, and that provides clues about how divergence proceeded
	in M. oregonensis during the dynamic Pleistocene. Unlike the approaches
	that either considered only the most recent coalescence (i.e., information
	from a single individual per population) or did not consider the
	pattern of coalescence in the gene genealogies, the population-divergence
	model that best fits the data was estimated by considering the pattern
	of gene lineage coalescence across multiple individuals, as well
	as loci. These results indicate that sampling of multiple individuals
	per population is critical to obtaining an accurate estimate of the
	history of divergence so that the signal of common ancestry can be
	separated from the confounding influence of gene flow-even though
	estimates suggest that gene flow is not a predominant factor structuring
	patterns of genetic variation across these sky island populations.
	They also suggest that the gene genealogies contain information about
	population relationships, despite the lack of complete sorting of
	gene lineages. What emerges from the analyses is a model of population
	divergence that incorporates both contemporary distributions and
	historical associations, and shows a latitudinal and regional structuring
	of populations reminiscent of population displacements into multiple
	glacial refugia. Because the population-divergence model itself is
	built upon the specific events shaping the history of M. oregonensis,
	it provides a framework for estimating additional population-genetic
	parameters relevant to understanding the processes governing differentiation
	in geographically structured species and avoids the problems of relying
	on overly simplified and inaccurate divergence models. The utility
	of these approaches, as well as the caveats and future improvements,
	for estimating population relationships and historical associations
	relevant to genetic analyses of geographically structured species

  abstract = {Genetic data are frequently used to delimit species, where species
	status is determined on the basis of an exclusivity criterium, such
	as reciprocal monophyly. Not only are there numerous empirical examples
	of incongruence between the boundaries inferred from such data compared
	to other sources like morphology -- especially with recently derived
	species, but population genetic theory also clearly shows that an
	inevitable bias in species status results because genetic thresholds
	do not explicitly take into account how the timing of speciation
	influences patterns of genetic differentiation. This study represents
	a fundamental shift in how genetic data might be used to delimit
	species. Rather than equating gene trees with a species tree or basing
	species status on some genetic threshold, the relationship between
	the gene trees and the species history is modeled probabilistically.
	Here we show that the same theory that is used to calculate the probability
	of reciprocal monophyly can also be used to delimit species despite
	widespread incomplete lineage sorting. The results from a preliminary
	simulation study suggest that very recently derived species can be
	accurately identified long before the requisite time for reciprocal
	monophyly to be achieved following speciation. The study also indicates
	the importance of sampling, both with regards to loci and individuals.
	Withstanding a thorough investigation into the conditions under which
	the coalescent-based approach will be effective, namely how the timing
	of divergence relative to the effective population size of species
	affects accurate species delimitation, the results are nevertheless
	consistent with other recent studies (aimed at inferring species
	relationships), showing that despite the lack of monophyletic gene
	trees, a signal of species divergence persists and can be extracted.
	Using an explicit model-based approach also avoids two primary problems
	with species delimitation that result when genetic thresholds are
	applied with genetic data -- the inherent biases in species detection
	arising from when and how speciation occurred, and failure to take
	into account the high stochastic variance of genetic processes. Both
	the utility and sensitivities of the coalescent-based approach outlined
	here are discussed; most notably, a model-based approach is essential
	for determining whether incompletely sorted gene lineages are (or
	are not) consistent with separate species lineages, and such inferences
	require accurate model parameterization (i.e., a range of realistic
	effective population sizes relative to potential times of divergence
	for the purported species). It is the goal (and motivation of this
	study) that genetic data might be used effectively as a source of
	complementation to other sources of data for diagnosing species,
	as opposed to the exclusion of other evidence for species delimitation,
	which will require an explicit consideration of the effects of the
	temporal dynamic of lineage splitting on genetic data.},

	well-supported clades, one composed of the two western subspecies
	(S. c. tergeminus and S. c. edwardsii) and the other the eastern

	however, there is not strong support across methods for any particular
	grouping at the subspecific level. Monophyly based tests for taxonomic
	distinctiveness show evidence for distinctiveness of all subspecies

	Because support for the distinctiveness of S. c. catenatus is both
	strong and consistent across methods, and due to its morphological

	amino-acid replacement pattern at different sites of a protein alignment
	to be described by distinct substitution processes. Our model, named
	CAT, assumes the existence of distinct processes (or classes) differing
	by their equilibrium frequencies over the 20 residues. Through the
	use of a Dirichlet process prior, the total number of classes and
	their respective amino-acid profiles, as well as the affiliations
	of each site to a given class, are all free variables of the model.
	In this way, the CAT model is able to adapt to the complexity actually
	present in the data, and it yields an estimate of the substitutional
	heterogeneity through the posterior mean number of classes. We show
	that a significant level of heterogeneity is present in the substitution
	patterns of proteins, and that the standard one-matrix model fails
	to account for this heterogeneity. By evaluating the Bayes factor,
	we demonstrate that the standard model is outperformed by CAT on
	all of the data sets which we analyzed. Altogether, these results
	suggest that the complexity of the pattern of substitution of real

	developed method can also be extended to treat more complicated CSI
	problems with ambiguous conserved patterns. RESULTS: A CSI problem
	is first formulated as a non-linear mixed 0-1 optimization program,
	which is then converted into a linear mixed 0-1 program. The proposed
	method provides the following advantages over maximum-likelihood
	methods: (1) It is guaranteed to find the global optimum. (2) It
	can embed various logical constraints into the corresponding model.
	(3) It is applicable to problems with many long sequences. (4) It
	can find the second and the third best solutions. An extension of
	the proposed linear mixed 0-1 program is also designed to solve CSI

  abstract = {The desire to infer the evolutionary history of a group of species
	should be more viable now that a considerable amount of multilocus
	molecular data is available. However, the current molecular phylogenetic
	paradigm still reconstructs gene trees to represent the species tree.
	Further, commonly used methods of combining data, such as the concatenation
	method, are known to be inconsistent in some circumstances. In this
	paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the phylogeny
	of a group of species using multiple estimated gene tree distributions,
	such as those that arise in a Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence data.
	Our model employs substitution models used in traditional phylogenetics
	but also uses coalescent theory to explain genealogical signals from
	species trees to gene trees and from gene trees to sequence data,
	thereby forming a complete stochastic model to estimate gene trees,
	species trees, ancestral population sizes, and species divergence
	times simultaneously. Our model is founded on the assumption that
	gene trees, even of unlinked loci, are correlated due to being derived
	from a single species tree and therefore should be estimated jointly.
	We apply the method to two multilocus data sets of DNA sequences.
	The estimates of the species tree topology and divergence times appear
	to be robust to the prior of the population size, whereas the estimates
	of effective population sizes are sensitive to the prior used in
	the analysis. These analyses also suggest that the model is superior
	to the concatenation method in fitting these data sets and thus provides
	a more realistic assessment of the variability in the distribution
	of the species tree that may have produced the molecular information
	at hand. Future improvements of our model and algorithm should include
	consideration of other factors that can cause discordance of gene
	trees and species trees, such as horizontal transfer or gene duplication.},

  abstract = {Several techniques, such as concatenation and consensus methods, are
	available for combining data from multiple loci to produce a single

	We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to reconstruct species trees

	proposed method for estimating species trees from single allele multilocus
	data. A two-step Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is adopted
	to estimate the posterior distribution of the species tree. The model
	is applied to estimate the posterior distribution of species trees
	for two multiple-allele datasets--yeast (Saccharomyces) and birds
	(Manacus-manakins). The estimates of the species trees using our
	method are consistent with those inferred from other methods and

	provides credible regions for the species tree. The Bayesian approach

	and behavioral diversity on a backdrop of genomic similarity. In
	2006, the Joint Genome Institute completed low coverage survey sequencing
	of the genomes of five phenotypically and ecologically diverse Lake
	Malawi species. We report a computational and comparative analysis
	of these data that provides insight into the mechanisms that make
	closely related species different from one another. RESULTS: We produced
	assemblies for the five species ranging in aggregate length from
	68 to 79 megabase pairs, identified putative orthologs for more than
	12,000 human genes, and predicted more than 32,000 cross-species
	single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Nucleotide diversity was
	lower than that found among laboratory strains of the zebrafish.
	We collected around 36,000 genotypes to validate a subset of SNPs
	within and among populations and across multiple individuals of about
	75 Lake Malawi species. Notably, there were no fixed differences
	observed between focal species nor between major lineages. Roughly
	3\% to 5\% of loci surveyed are statistical outliers for genetic
	differentiation (FST) within species, between species, and between
	major lineages. Outliers for FST are candidate genes that may have
	experienced a history of natural selection in the Malawi lineage.
	CONCLUSION: We present a novel genome sequencing strategy, which
	is useful when evolutionary diversity is the question of interest.
	Lake Malawi cichlids are phenotypically and behaviorally diverse,
	but they appear genetically like a subdivided population. The unique
	structure of Lake Malawl cichlid genomes should facilitate conceptually
	new experiments, employing SNPs to identity genotype-phenotype association,
	using the entire species flock as a mapping panel.},

	finding the distribution of genealogies: we allow migration between
	demes, splitting of demes [as in the isolation-with-migration (IM)
	model], and recombination between linked loci. These processes are
	described by a set of linear recursions for the generating function
	of branch lengths. Under the infinite-sites model, the probability
	of any configuration of mutations can be found by differentiating
	this generating function. Such calculations are feasible for small
	numbers of sampled genomes: as an example, we show how the generating
	function can be derived explicitly for three genes under the two-deme
	IM model. This derivation is done automatically, using Mathematica.
	Given data from a large number of unlinked and nonrecombining blocks
	of sequence, these results can be used to find maximum-likelihood
	estimates of model parameters by tabulating the probabilities of
	all relevant mutational configurations and then multiplying across
	loci. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by applying it
	to simulated data and to a data set previously analyzed by Wang and
	Hey (2010) consisting of 26,141 loci sampled from Drosophila simulans

  abstract = {A method for simultaneously estimating the admixture proportions of
	a hybrid population and Wright's fixation index, FST, for that hybrid
	is presented. It is shown that the variance of admixture estimates
	can be partitioned into two components: (1) due to sample size, and
	(2) due to evolutionary variance (i.e., genetic drift). A chi-square
	test used to detect heterogeneity of admixture estimates from different
	alleles, or loci, can now be corrected for both sources of random
	errors. Hence, its value for the detection of natural selection from
	heterogeneous admixture estimates is improved. The estimation and
	testing procedures described above are independent of the dynamics
	of the admixture process. However, when the admixture dynamics can
	be specified, FST can be predicted from genetic principles. Two admixture
	models are considered here, gene flow and intermixture. These models
	are of value because they lead to very different predictions regarding
	the accumulation of genes from the parental populations and the accumulation
	of variance due to genetic drift. When there is not evidence for
	natural selection, and it is appropriate to apply these models to
	data, the variance effective size (Ne) of the hybrid population can
	be estimated. Applications are made to three human populations: two
	of these are Afro-American populations and one is a Yanomamö Indian
	village. Natural selection could not be detected using the chi-square
	test in any of these populations. However, estimates of effective
	population sizes do lead to a richer description of the genetic structure
	of these populations.},

  title = {Bayesian coestimation of phylogeny and sequence alignment.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {83},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two central problems in computational biology are the
	determination of the alignment and phylogeny of a set of biological
	sequences. The traditional approach to this problem is to first build
	a multiple alignment of these sequences, followed by a phylogenetic
	reconstruction step based on this multiple alignment. However, alignment
	and phylogenetic inference are fundamentally interdependent, and
	ignoring this fact leads to biased and overconfident estimations.
	Whether the main interest be in sequence alignment or phylogeny,
	a major goal of computational biology is the co-estimation of both.
	RESULTS: We developed a fully Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method
	for coestimating phylogeny and sequence alignment, under the Thorne-Kishino-Felsenstein
	model of substitution and single nucleotide insertion-deletion (indel)
	events. In our earlier work, we introduced a novel and efficient
	algorithm, termed the "indel peeling algorithm", which includes indels
	as phylogenetically informative evolutionary events, and resembles
	Felsenstein's peeling algorithm for substitutions on a phylogenetic
	tree. For a fixed alignment, our extension analytically integrates
	out both substitution and indel events within a proper statistical
	model, without the need for data augmentation at internal tree nodes,
	allowing for efficient sampling of tree topologies and edge lengths.
	To additionally sample multiple alignments, we here introduce an
	efficient partial Metropolized independence sampler for alignments,
	and combine these two algorithms into a fully Bayesian co-estimation
	procedure for the alignment and phylogeny problem. Our approach results
	in estimates for the posterior distribution of evolutionary rate
	parameters, for the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) phylogenetic tree,
	and for the posterior decoding alignment. Estimates for the evolutionary
	tree and multiple alignment are augmented with confidence estimates
	for each node height and alignment column. Our results indicate that
	the patterns in reliability broadly correspond to structural features
	of the proteins, and thus provides biologically meaningful information
	which is not existent in the usual point-estimate of the alignment.
	Our methods can handle input data of moderate size (10-20 protein
	sequences, each 100-200 bp), which we analyzed overnight on a standard
	2 GHz personal computer. CONCLUSION: Joint analysis of multiple sequence
	alignment, evolutionary trees and additional evolutionary parameters
	can be now done within a single coherent statistical framework.},

	difficulties for phylogenetic inference, but little attention has
	been paid to methods that attempt to overcome these difficulties
	by explicitly considering the processes that produce them. Here we
	explore approaches to phylogenetic inference designed to consider
	retention and sorting of ancestral polymorphism. We examine how the
	reconstructability of a species (or population) phylogeny is affected
	by (a) the number of loci used to estimate the phylogeny and (b)
	the number of individuals sampled per species. Even in difficult
	cases with considerable incomplete lineage sorting (times between
	divergences less than 1 N(e) generations), we found the reconstructed
	species trees matched the "true" species trees in at least three
	out of five partitions, as long as a reasonable number of individuals
	per species were sampled. We also studied the tradeoff between sampling
	more loci versus more individuals. Although increasing the number
	of loci gives more accurate trees for a given sampling effort with
	deeper species trees (e.g., total depth of 10 N(e) generations),
	sampling more individuals often gives better results than sampling
	more loci with shallower species trees (e.g., depth = 1 N(e)). Taken
	together, these results demonstrate that gene sequences retain enough
	signal to achieve an accurate estimate of phylogeny despite widespread
	incomplete lineage sorting. Continued improvement in our methods
	to reconstruct phylogeny near the species level will require a shift
	to a compound model that considers not only nucleotide or character
	state substitutions, but also the population genetics processes of
	lineage sorting. [Coalescence; divergence; population; speciation.].},

	The study demonstrates that the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Delimiting species boundaries and reconstructing
	the evolutionary relationships of late Tertiary and Quaternary species
	radiations is difficult. One recent approach emphasizes the use of
	genome-wide molecular markers, such as amplified fragment length
	polymorphisms (AFLPs) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
	to identify distinct metapopulation lineages as taxonomic species.
	Here we investigate the properties of AFLP data, and the usefulness
	of tree-based and non-tree-based clustering methods to delimit species
	and reconstruct evolutionary relationships among high-elevation Ourisia
	species (Plantaginaceae) in the New Zealand archipelago. RESULTS:
	New Zealand Ourisia are shown to comprise a geologically recent species
	radiation based on molecular dating analyses of nITS sequences (0.4-1.3
	MY). Supernetwork analyses indicate that separate tree-based clustering
	analyses of four independent AFLP primer combinations and 193 individuals
	of Ourisia produced similar trees. When combined and analysed using
	tree building methods, 15 distinct metapopulations could be identified.
	These clusters corresponded very closely to species and subspecies
	identified on the basis of diagnostic morphological characters. In
	contrast, Structure and PCO-MC analyses of the same data identified
	a maximum of 12 and 8 metapopulations, respectively. All approaches
	resolved a large-leaved group and a small-leaved group, as well as
	a lineage of three alpine species within the small-leaved group.
	We were unable to further resolve relationships within these groups
	as corrected and uncorrected distances derived from AFLP profiles
	had limited tree-like properties. CONCLUSIONS: Ourisia radiated into
	a range of alpine and subalpine habitats in New Zealand during the
	Pleistocene, resulting in 13 morphologically and ecologically distinct
	species, including one reinstated from subspecies rank. Analyses
	of AFLP identified distinct metapopulations consistent with morphological
	characters allowing species boundaries to be delimited in Ourisia.
	Importantly, Structure analyses suggest some degree of admixture
	with most species, which may also explain why the AFLP data do not
	exhibit sufficient tree-like properties necessary for reconstructing
	some species relationships. We discuss this feature and highlight
	the importance of improving models for phylogenetic analyses of species
	radiations using AFLP and SNP data.},

	an alternative to change-point modeling that exploits Gaussian Markov

	the sparseness of breakpoint data, dictated by the modest number

	in the Neotropics. An understanding of A. darlingi's population structure
	and contemporary gene flow patterns is necessary if vector populations
	are to be successfully controlled. We assessed population genetic
	structure and levels of differentiation based on 1,376 samples from
	31 localities throughout the Peruvian and Brazilian Amazon and Central
	America using 5-8 microsatellite loci. RESULTS: We found high levels
	of polymorphism for all of the Amazonian populations (mean RS = 7.62,
	mean HO = 0.742), and low levels for the Belize and Guatemalan populations
	(mean RS = 4.3, mean HO = 0.457). The Bayesian clustering analysis
	revealed five population clusters: northeastern Amazonian Brazil,
	southeastern and central Amazonian Brazil, western and central Amazonian
	Brazil, Peruvian Amazon, and the Central American populations. Within
	Central America there was low non-significant differentiation, except
	for between the populations separated by the Maya Mountains. Within
	Amazonia there was a moderate level of significant differentiation
	attributed to isolation by distance. Within Peru there was no significant
	population structure and low differentiation, and some evidence of
	a population expansion. The pairwise estimates of genetic differentiation
	between Central America and Amazonian populations were all very high
	and highly significant (FST = 0.1859 - 0.3901, P < 0.05). Both the
	DA and FST distance-based trees illustrated the main division to
	be between Central America and Amazonia. CONCLUSION: We detected
	a large amount of population structure in Amazonia, with three population
	clusters within Brazil and one including the Peru populations. The
	considerable differences in Ne among the populations may have contributed
	to the observed genetic differentiation. All of the data suggest
	that the primary division within A. darlingi corresponds to two white
	gene genotypes between Amazonia (genotype 1) and Central America,
	parts of Colombia and Venezuela (genotype 2), and are in agreement
	with previously published mitochondrial COI gene sequences interpreted
	as incipient species. Overall, it appears that two main factors have
	contributed to the genetic differentiation between the population

	ago, although debate on its origin remains contentious. A single-origin
	model suggests that two main subspecies of Asian rice, indica and
	japonica, were domesticated from the wild rice O. rufipogon. In contrast,
	the multiple independent domestication model proposes that these
	two major rice types were domesticated separately and in different

	much support from the observation of strong genetic differentiation

	these quantities are developed. These statistical methods are applicable
	to both nuclear and nonnuclear DNAs. When evolutionary change of
	nucleons occurs mainly by mutation and genetic drift, all the measures
	can be expressed in terms of the product of mutation rate per nucleon
	and effective population size. A method for estimating nucleotide
	diversity from nucleon diversity is also presented under certain
	assumptions. It is shown that DNA divergence between two populations
	can be studied either by the average number of restriction site differences
	or by the average number of nucleotide differences. In either case,
	a large number of different restriction enzymes should be used for
	studying phylogenetic relationships among related organisms, since
	the effect of stochastic factors on these quantities is very large.
	The statistical methods developed have been applied to data of Shah
	and Langley on mitochondrial (mt)DNA from Drosophila melanogaster,
	simulans and virilis. This application has suggested that the evolutionary

	have begun to shift toward an agriculture-based lifestyle over the

	subsistence on hunting and gathering. The Pygmies are considered

	We resequenced 24 independent noncoding regions across the genome,

	Pygmy groups approximately 20,000 years ago. Our findings increase

	complex has been a subject of controversy. All three possible groupings

	studies suggest that D. erecta and D. yakuba are sister species.
	Using the whole genomes of each of these species as well as the four
	other fully sequenced species in the subgenus Sophophora, we set
	out to investigate the placement of D. erecta and D. yakuba in the
	D. melanogaster species group and to understand the cause of the
	past incongruence. Though we find that the phylogeny grouping D.
	erecta and D. yakuba together is the best supported, we also find
	widespread incongruence in nucleotide and amino acid substitutions,
	insertions and deletions, and gene trees. The time inferred to span
	the two key speciation events is short enough that under the coalescent
	model, the incongruence could be the result of incomplete lineage
	sorting. Consistent with the lineage-sorting hypothesis, substitutions
	supporting the same tree were spatially clustered. Support for the
	different trees was found to be linked to recombination such that
	adjacent genes support the same tree most often in regions of low
	recombination and substitutions supporting the same tree are most
	enriched roughly on the same scale as linkage disequilibrium, also
	consistent with lineage sorting. The incongruence was found to be
	statistically significant and robust to model and species choice.
	No systematic biases were found. We conclude that phylogenetic incongruence
	in the D. melanogaster species complex is the result, at least in
	part, of incomplete lineage sorting. Incomplete lineage sorting will
	likely cause phylogenetic incongruence in many comparative genomics
	datasets. Methods to infer the correct species tree, the history
	of every base in the genome, and comparative methods that control
	for and/or utilize this information will be valuable advancements
	for the field of comparative genomics.},

	estimate the demographic history of these populations, sometimes
	resulting in complex scenarios of fluctuations in population size,
	which can be correlated with the timing of environmental events,
	such as glaciations. Recently, however, Axelsson et al. (Axelsson
	E, Willerslev E, Gilbert MTP, Nielsen R. 2008. The effect of ancient
	DNA damage on inferences of demographic histories. Mol Biol Evol
	25:2181-2187.) claimed that many of these complex demographic trends

	they investigate by removing all sites involving transitions from
	ancient sequences prior to analysis. When this solution is applied
	to a previously published data set of Pleistocene bison, they show
	that the demographic signal of population expansion and decline disappears.
	Although some apparently segregating mutations in ancient sequences
	may be due to postmortem damage, we argue that discarding the data
	will result in loss of power to detect patterns of population change.
	Instead, to accommodate this problem, we implement a model in which
	sequences are the result of a joint process of molecular evolution
	and postmortem DNA damage within a probabilistic inference framework.
	Through simulation, we demonstrate the ability of this model to accurately
	recover evolutionary parameters, demographic history, and DNA damage
	rates. When this model is applied to the bison data set, we find
	that the rate of DNA damage is significant but low and that the reconstruction

	coalescence times. Information about the relative frequency of disease
	mutations in exons, introns, and other regions, from mutational databases,
	as well as assumptions about the completeness of the gene annotation,
	are used with an annotated HGS, to generate a prior probability that

	mutation location, from LD at a set of linked markers in the region,
	to generate the posterior probability density of the mutation location.
	The performance of the method is evaluated by simulation and by analysis
	of a data set for diastrophic dysplasia (DTD) in Finland. The DTD
	disease gene has been positionally cloned, so the actual location
	of the mutation is known and can be compared with the position predicted

	an HGS results in disease-gene localization at a resolution that
	is much higher than that which would be possible by LD mapping alone.
	In this case, the gene would be found by sequencing a region < or

	A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is implemented to integrate

	handle any species tree and allows different numbers of sequences
	at different loci. We apply the method to published noncoding DNA
	sequences from the human and the great apes. There are strong correlations
	between posterior estimates of speciation times and ancestral population

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phylogenies of rapidly evolving pathogens can be difficult
	to resolve because of the small number of substitutions that accumulate
	in the short times since divergence. To improve resolution of such
	phylogenies we propose using insertion and deletion (indel) information
	in addition to substitution information. We accomplish this through
	joint estimation of alignment and phylogeny in a Bayesian framework,
	drawing inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Joint estimation
	of alignment and phylogeny sidesteps biases that stem from conditioning
	on a single alignment by taking into account the ensemble of near-optimal
	alignments. RESULTS: We introduce a novel Markov chain transition
	kernel that improves computational efficiency by proposing non-local
	topology rearrangements and by block sampling alignment and topology
	parameters. In addition, we extend our previous indel model to increase
	biological realism by placing indels preferentially on longer branches.
	We demonstrate the ability of indel information to increase phylogenetic
	resolution in examples drawn from within-host viral sequence samples.
	We also demonstrate the importance of taking alignment uncertainty
	into account when using such information. Finally, we show that codon-based
	substitution models can significantly affect alignment quality and
	phylogenetic inference by unrealistically forcing indels to begin
	and end between codons. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that indel
	information can improve phylogenetic resolution of recently diverged
	pathogens and that alignment uncertainty should be considered in
	such analyses.},

	Furthermore, because the alignment and phylogeny are constructed
	simultaneously, a guide tree is not needed. This sidesteps the problem
	in which alignments created by progressive alignment are biased toward
	the guide tree used to generate them. Joint estimation also allows

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate inference of genetic discontinuities between
	populations is an essential component of intraspecific biodiversity
	and evolution studies, as well as associative genetics. The most
	widely-used methods to infer population structure are model-based,
	Bayesian MCMC procedures that minimize Hardy-Weinberg and linkage
	disequilibrium within subpopulations. These methods are useful, but
	suffer from large computational requirements and a dependence on
	modeling assumptions that may not be met in real data sets. Here
	we describe the development of a new approach, PCO-MC, which couples
	principal coordinate analysis to a clustering procedure for the inference
	of population structure from multilocus genotype data. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
	FINDINGS: PCO-MC uses data from all principal coordinate axes simultaneously
	to calculate a multidimensional "density landscape", from which the
	number of subpopulations, and the membership within subpopulations,
	is determined using a valley-seeking algorithm. Using extensive simulations,
	we show that this approach outperforms a Bayesian MCMC procedure
	when many loci (e.g. 100) are sampled, but that the Bayesian procedure
	is marginally superior with few loci (e.g. 10). When presented with
	sufficient data, PCO-MC accurately delineated subpopulations with
	population F(st) values as low as 0.03 (G'(st)>0.2), whereas the
	limit of resolution of the Bayesian approach was F(st) = 0.05 (G'(st)>0.35).
	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We draw a distinction between population
	structure inference for describing biodiversity as opposed to Type
	I error control in associative genetics. We suggest that discrete
	assignments, like those produced by PCO-MC, are appropriate for circumscribing
	units of biodiversity whereas expression of population structure
	as a continuous variable is more useful for case-control correction
	in structured association studies.},

	Analysis of molecular variance showed this data to be highly structured.
	A series of genetic distances among populations was computed based

	ambiguous outcomes occurred in inverse proportion to the number of

  abstract = {We evaluate the performance of maximum likelihood (ML) analysis of
	allele frequency data in a linear array of populations. The parameters
	are a mutation rate and either the dispersal rate in a stepping stone
	model or a dispersal rate and a scale parameter in a geometric dispersal
	model. An approximate procedure known as maximum product of approximate
	conditional (PAC) likelihood is found to perform as well as ML. Mis-specification
	biases may occur because the importance sampling algorithm is formally
	defined in term of mutation and migration rates scaled by the total
	size of the population, and this size may differ widely in the statistical
	model and in reality. As could be expected, ML generally performs
	well when the statistical model is correctly specified. Otherwise,
	mutation rate estimates are much closer to mutation probability scaled
	by number of demes in the statistical model than scaled by number
	of demes in reality when mutation probability is high and dispersal
	is most limited. This mis-specification bias actually has practical
	benefits. However, opposite results are found in opposite conditions.
	Migration rate estimates show roughly similar trends, but they may
	not always be easily interpreted as low-bias estimates of dispersal
	rate under any scaling. Estimation of the dispersal scale parameter
	is also affected by mis-specification of the number of demes, and
	the different biases compensate each other in such a way that good
	estimation of the so-called neighborhood size (or more precisely
	the product of population density and mean-squared parent-offspring
	dispersal distance) is achieved. Results congruent with these findings
	are found in an application to a damselfly data set.},

	method utilizes the differences accumulated by random genetic drift
	in allele count data from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
	ignoring the effect of mutation after divergence from the common

	involves both maximizing likelihood over branch lengths of a given

	Here our focus is the maximization of likelihood over branch lengths
	of a given topology. The pruning algorithm computes arrays of probabilities
	at the root of the tree from the data at the tips of the tree; at
	the root, the arrays determine the likelihood. The arrays consist
	of probabilities related to the number of coalescences and allele
	counts for the partially coalesced lineages. Computing these probabilities

  year = {2007},
  volume = {7 Suppl 1},
  pages = {S3},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most studies inferring species phylogenies use sequences
	from single copy genes or sets of orthologs culled from gene families.
	For taxa such as plants, with very high levels of gene duplication
	in their nuclear genomes, this has limited the exploitation of nuclear
	sequences for phylogenetic studies, such as those available in large
	EST libraries. One rarely used method of inference, gene tree parsimony,
	can infer species trees from gene families undergoing duplication
	and loss, but its performance has not been evaluated at a phylogenomic
	scale for EST data in plants. RESULTS: A gene tree parsimony analysis
	based on EST data was undertaken for six angiosperm model species
	and Pinus, an outgroup. Although a large fraction of the tentative
	consensus sequences obtained from the TIGR database of ESTs was assembled
	into homologous clusters too small to be phylogenetically informative,
	some 557 clusters contained promising levels of information. Based
	on maximum likelihood estimates of the gene trees obtained from these
	clusters, gene tree parsimony correctly inferred the accepted species
	tree with strong statistical support. A slight variant of this species
	tree was obtained when maximum parsimony was used to infer the individual
	gene trees instead. CONCLUSION: Despite the complexity of the EST
	data and the relatively small fraction eventually used in inferring
	a species tree, the gene tree parsimony method performed well in
	the face of very high apparent rates of duplication.},

	decreased computational cost relative to the Markov chain Monte Carlo
	(MCMC) algorithms that have generally been used in earlier studies.
	We present experiments exploring these modeling and algorithmic issues

	populations, and the inference of allele frequencies in one ancestral

	involved in performing these studies is that the underlying population
	substructure could produce spurious associations. Population substructure
	can be caused by the presence of two distinct subpopulations or a
	single pool of admixed individuals. In this work, we focus on the
	latter, which is significantly harder to detect in practice. New
	advances in this research direction are expected to play a key role
	in identifying loci that are different among different populations
	and are still associated with a disease. We evaluated current methods
	for inference of population substructure in such cases and show that
	they might be quite inaccurate even in relatively simple scenarios.
	We therefore introduce a new method, LAMP (Local Ancestry in adMixed
	Populations), which infers the ancestry of each individual at every
	single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). LAMP computes the ancestry
	structure for overlapping windows of contiguous SNPs and combines
	the results with a majority vote. Our empirical results show that
	LAMP is significantly more accurate and more efficient than existing
	methods for inferring locus-specific ancestries, enabling it to handle
	large-scale datasets. We further show that LAMP can be used to estimate
	the individual admixture of each individual. Our experimental evaluation
	indicates that this extension yields a considerably more accurate
	estimate of individual admixture than state-of-the-art methods such
	as STRUCTURE or EIGENSTRAT, which are frequently used for the correction

	We argue that genealogical approaches, although sometimes useful,

	we suggest that population genetic approaches that rely on large
	sets of informative markers like single nucleotide polymorphisms

	derived species. We address two major challenges in applying such
	markers to species delimitation: discovering markers in nonmodel
	systems and using them to delimit recently derived species. Using
	turtles as a test case, we explore the utility of a single, relatively
	low-coverage genomic resource as an aid in gene and marker discovery.
	We exploit an end-sequenced bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
	library from an individual painted turtle (Chrysemys picta) and outline
	a novel protocol that efficiently identifies primer pairs that amplify
	homologous sequences across the tree of living turtles. Preliminary
	data using this library to discover SNPs in Emydura macquarii, a
	species that diverged from C. picta approximately 210 million years
	ago, indicate that sequences identified from the Chrysemys BAC library
	provide useful SNPs even in this very distantly related taxon. Several
	recent methods in wide use in the population genetics literature
	allow one to discover potential species, or test existing species
	hypotheses, with SNP data and may be particularly informative for
	very recently derived species. As BAC and other genomic resources
	become increasingly available for scattered taxa across the tree
	of life, we are optimistic that these resources will provide abundant,

	model with no mutation, the estimators can be expressed as simple
	functions of estimates of the F-statistic parameters F(IT) and F(ST).
	In the finite-island model with mutation among k alleles, mutation
	rate, migration rate, and effective population size can be simultaneously
	estimated. The estimates of migration rate and effective population

  abstract = {We show that the unstructured ancestral selection graph applies to
	part of the history of a sample from a population structured by restricted
	migration among subpopulations, or demes. The result holds in the
	limit as the number of demes tends to infinity with proportionately
	weak selection, and we have also made the assumptions of island-type
	migration and that demes are equivalent in size. After an instantaneous
	sample-size adjustment, this structured ancestral selection graph
	converges to an unstructured ancestral selection graph with a mutation
	parameter that depends inversely on the migration rate. In contrast,
	the selection parameter for the population is independent of the
	migration rate and is identical to the selection parameter in an
	unstructured population. We show analytically that estimators of
	the migration rate, based on pairwise sequence differences, derived
	under the assumption of neutrality should perform equally well in
	the presence of weak selection. We also modify an algorithm for simulating
	genealogies conditional on the frequencies of two selected alleles
	in a sample. This permits efficient simulation of stronger selection
	than was previously possible. Using this new algorithm, we simulate
	gene genealogies under the many-demes ancestral selection graph and
	identify some situations in which migration has a strong effect on
	the time to the most recent common ancestor of the sample. We find
	that a similar effect also increases the sensitivity of the genealogy
	to selection.},

	in regular systems of mating to find the distribution of coalescence
	times and the mean coalescence times. It is also possible to express
	Sewall Wright's FST as the ratio of average coalescence times of
	different pairs of genes. That simplifies the analysis of models
	of subdivided populations because the average coalescence time can
	be found by computing separately the time it takes for two genes
	to enter a single subpopulation and time it takes for two genes in
	the same subpopulation to coalesce. The first time depends only on
	the migration matrix and the second time depends only on the total
	number of individuals in the population. This approach is used to
	find FST in the finite island model and in one- and two-dimensional
	stepping-stone models. It is also used to find the rate of approach
	of FST to its equilibrium value. These results are discussed in terms
	of different measures of genetic distance. It is proposed that, for
	the purposes of describing the amount of gene flow among local populations,
	the effective migration rate between pairs of local populations,
	M, which is the migration rate that would be estimated for those
	two populations if they were actually in an island model, provides

	contraction, we performed a coalescent analysis of multilocus microsatellite

	strong evidence that savannah baboons have undergone a long-term

  abstract = {Microsatellite DNA loci or short tandem repeats (STRs) are abundant
	in eukaryotic genomes and are often used for constructing phylogenetic
	trees of closely related populations or species. These phylogenetic
	trees are usually constructed by using some genetic distance measure
	based on allele frequency data, and there are many distance measures
	that have been proposed for this purpose. In the past the efficiencies
	of these distance measures in constructing phylogenetic trees have
	been studied mathematically or by computer simulations. Recently,
	however, allele frequencies of 783 STR loci have been compiled from
	various human populations. We have therefore used these empirical
	data to investigate the relative efficiencies of different distance
	measures in constructing phylogenetic trees. The results showed that
	(1) the probability of obtaining the correct branching pattern of
	a tree (PC) is generally highest for DA distance; (2) FST*, standard
	genetic distance (DS), and FST/(1-FST) give similar PC-values, FST*
	being slightly better than the other two; and (3) (deltamu)2 shows
	PC-values much lower than the other distance measures. To have reasonably
	high PC-values for trees similar to ours, at least 30 loci with a
	minimum of 15 individuals are required when DA distance is used.},

  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {81},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: DNA barcoding of life using a standardized COI sequence
	was proposed as a species identification system, and as a method
	for detecting putative new species. Previous tests in birds showed
	that individuals can be correctly assigned to species in ~94\% of
	the cases and suggested a threshold of 10x mean intraspecific difference
	to detect potential new species. However, these tests were criticized
	because they were based on a single maternally inherited gene rather
	than multiple nuclear genes, did not compare phylogenetically identified
	sister species, and thus likely overestimated the efficacy of DNA
	barcodes in identifying species. RESULTS: To test the efficacy of
	DNA barcodes we compared ~650 bp of COI in 60 sister-species pairs
	identified in multigene phylogenies from 10 orders of birds. In all
	pairs, individuals of each species were monophyletic in a neighbor-joining
	(NJ) tree, and each species possessed fixed mutational differences
	distinguishing them from their sister species. Consequently, individuals
	were correctly assigned to species using a statistical coalescent
	framework. A coalescent test of taxonomic distinctiveness based on
	chance occurrence of reciprocal monophyly in two lineages was verified
	in known sister species, and used to identify recently separated
	lineages that represent putative species. This approach avoids the
	use of a universal distance cutoff which is invalidated by variation
	in times to common ancestry of sister species and in rates of evolution.
	CONCLUSION: Closely related sister species of birds can be identified
	reliably by barcodes of fixed diagnostic substitutions in COI sequences,
	verifying coalescent-based statistical tests of reciprocal monophyly
	for taxonomic distinctiveness. Contrary to recent criticisms, a single
	DNA barcode is a rapid way to discover monophyletic lineages within
	a metapopulation that might represent undiscovered cryptic species,
	as envisaged in the unified species concept. This identifies a smaller
	set of lineages that can also be tested independently for species
	status with multiple nuclear gene approaches and other phenotypic
	characters.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Effective management depends upon accurately estimating

	estimating abundance. Two population estimation methods, double observer
	(DO) and double sampling (DS), have been advocated for avian population
	studies and the relative merits and short-comings of these methods
	remain an area of debate. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used
	simulations to evaluate the performances of these two population
	estimation methods under a range of realistic scenarios. For three
	hypothetical populations with different levels of clustering, we
	generated DO and DS population size estimates for a range of detection
	probabilities and survey proportions. Population estimates for both
	methods were centered on the true population size for all levels
	of population clustering and survey proportions when detection probabilities
	were greater than 20\%. The DO method underestimated the population
	at detection probabilities less than 30\% whereas the DS method remained
	essentially unbiased. The coverage probability of 95\% confidence
	intervals for population estimates was slightly less than the nominal
	level for the DS method but was substantially below the nominal level
	for the DO method at high detection probabilities. Differences in
	observer detection probabilities did not affect the accuracy and
	precision of population estimates of the DO method. Population estimates
	for the DS method remained unbiased as the proportion of units intensively
	surveyed changed, but the variance of the estimates decreased with
	increasing proportion intensively surveyed. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
	The DO and DS methods can be applied in many different settings and
	our evaluations provide important information on the performance
	of these two methods that can assist researchers in selecting the
	method most appropriate for their particular needs.},

  abstract = {The estimation of ancestral and current effective population sizes
	in expanding populations is a fundamental problem in population genetics.
	Recently it has become possible to scan entire genomes of several
	individuals within a population. These genomic data sets can be used
	to estimate basic population parameters such as the effective population
	size and population growth rate. Full-data-likelihood methods potentially
	offer a powerful statistical framework for inferring population genetic
	parameters. However, for large data sets, computationally intensive
	methods based upon full-likelihood estimates may encounter difficulties.
	First, the computational method may be prohibitively slow or difficult
	to implement for large data. Second, estimation bias may markedly
	affect the accuracy and reliability of parameter estimates, as suggested
	from past work on coalescent methods. To address these problems,
	a fast and computationally efficient least-squares method for estimating
	population parameters from genomic data is presented here. Instead
	of modeling genomic data using a full likelihood, this new approach
	uses an analogous function, in which the full data are replaced with
	a vector of summary statistics. Furthermore, these least-squares
	estimators may show significantly less estimation bias for growth
	rate and genetic diversity than a corresponding maximum-likelihood
	estimator for the same coalescent process. The least-squares statistics
	also scale up to genome-sized data sets with many nucleotides and
	loci. These results demonstrate that least-squares statistics will
	likely prove useful for nonlinear parameter estimation when the underlying
	population genomic processes have complex evolutionary dynamics involving
	interactions between mutation, selection, demography, and recombination.},

	information in inferring the admixture proportions (parental contributions)
	of a hybrid population. The majority of these estimators used allele
	frequency data, ignored molecular information that is available in
	markers such as microsatellites and DNA sequences, and assumed that
	mutations are absent since the admixture event. As a result, these
	estimators may fail to deliver an estimate or give rather poor estimates
	when admixture is ancient and thus mutations are not negligible.
	A previous molecular estimator based its inference of admixture proportions
	on the average coalescent times between pairs of genes taken from
	within and between populations. In this article I propose an estimator
	that considers the entire genealogy of all of the sampled genes and
	infers admixture proportions from the numbers of segregating sites
	in DNA sequence samples. By considering the genealogy of all sequences
	rather than pairs of sequences, this new estimator also allows the
	joint estimation of other interesting parameters in the admixture
	model, such as admixture time, divergence time, population size,
	and mutation rate. Comparative analyses of simulated data indicate
	that the new coalescent estimator generally yields better estimates
	of admixture proportions than the previous molecular estimator, especially
	when the parental populations are not highly differentiated. It also
	gives reasonably accurate estimates of other admixture parameters.

	of the processes of inbreeding and genetic drift for which Ne is
	usually defined and measured, and because of the many factors (such
	as time and spatial scales, systematic forces) confounding such processes.
	Many methods have been developed in the past three decades to estimate
	the current, past and ancient effective population sizes using different
	information extracted from some genetic markers in a sample of individuals.
	This paper reviews the methodologies proposed for estimating Ne from
	genetic data using information on heterozygosity excess, linkage
	disequilibrium, temporal changes in allele frequency, and pattern
	and amount of genetic variation within and between populations. For
	each methodology, I describe mainly the logic and genetic model on
	which it is based, the data required and information used, the interpretation
	of the estimate obtained, some results from applications to simulated
	or empirical datasets and future developments that are needed.},

  abstract = {A pseudo maximum likelihood method is proposed to estimate effective
	population size (Ne) using temporal changes in allele frequencies
	at multi-allelic loci. The computation is simplified dramatically
	by (1) approximating the multi-dimensional joint probabilities of
	all the data by the product of marginal probabilities (hence the
	name pseudo-likelihood), (2) exploiting the special properties of
	transition matrix and (3) using a hidden Markov chain algorithm.
	Simulations show that the pseudo-likelihood method has a similar
	performance but needs much less computing time and storage compared
	with the full likelihood method in the case of 3 alleles per locus.
	Due to computational developments, I was able to assess the performance
	of the pseudo-likelihood method against the F-statistic method over
	a wide range of parameters by extensive simulations. It is shown
	that the pseudo-likelihood method gives more accurate and precise
	estimates of Ne than the F-statistic method, and the performance
	difference is mainly due to the presence of rare alleles in the samples.
	The pseudo-likelihood method is also flexible and can use three or
	more temporal samples simultaneously to estimate satisfactorily the
	NeS of each period, or the growth parameters of the population. The
	accuracy and precision of both methods depend on the ratio of the
	product of sample size and the number of generations involved to
	Ne, and the number of independent alleles used. In an application
	of the pseudo-likelihood method to a large data set of an olive fly
	population, more precise estimates of Ne are obtained than those
	from the F-statistic method.},

	induces a localized phylogenetic structure which may vary along the

	changes in phylogeny along multiple sequence alignments while accounting
	for rate heterogeneity; the hidden states refer to the unobserved
	phylogenic topology underlying the relatedness at a genomic location.
	The dimensionality of the number of hidden states (topologies) and
	their structure are random (not known a priori) and are sampled using
	Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The HMM structure allows us
	to analytically integrate out over all possible changepoints in topologies
	as well as all the unknown branch lengths. RESULTS: We demonstrate
	our approach on simulated data and also to the genome of a suspected
	HIV recombinant strain as well as to an investigation of recombination

	sharing a neutral rare allele. We suppose that the mutation giving
	rise to the allele has only happened once in the history of the entire
	population, and that the allele is of known frequency q in the population.
	Within a coalescent framework C. Wiuf and P. Donnelly (1999, Theor.
	Popul. Biol. 56, 183-201) derived an exact analysis of the conditional
	genealogy but it is inconvenient for applications. Here, we develop
	an approximation to the exact distribution of the conditional genealogy,
	including an approximation to the distribution of the time at which
	the mutation arose. The approximations are accurate for frequencies
	q<5-10\%. In addition, a simple and fast simulation scheme is constructed.
	We consider a demography parameterized by a d-dimensional vector
	alpha=(alpha(1), em leader, alpha(d)). It is shown that the conditional
	genealogy and the age of the mutation have distributions that depend
	on a=qalpha and q only, and that the effect of q is a linear scaling
	of times in the genealogy; if q is doubled, the lengths of all branches
	in the genealogy are doubled. The theory is exemplified in two different
	demographies of some interest in the study of human evolution: (1)
	a population of constant size and (2) a population of exponentially
	decreasing size (going backward in time).},

	In this article I extend previous work for estimating ancestral population

	nucleotide substitution model. Both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayes
	methods are implemented for joint estimation of the two speciation
	dates and the two population size parameters. Both methods account
	for uncertainties in the gene tree due to few informative sites at
	each locus and make an efficient use of information in the data.
	The Bayes algorithm using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) enjoys
	a computational advantage over ML and also provides a framework for
	incorporating prior information about the parameters. The methods
	are applied to a data set of 53 nuclear noncoding contigs from human,
	chimpanzee, and gorilla published by Chen and Li. Estimates of the
	effective population size for the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees
	by both ML and Bayes methods are approximately 12,000-21,000, comparable
	to estimates for modern humans, and do not support the notion of
	a dramatic size reduction in early human populations. Estimates published
	previously from the same data are several times larger and appear
	to be biased due to methodological deficiency. The divergence between
	humans and chimpanzees is dated at approximately 5.2 million years
	ago and the gorilla divergence 1.1-1.7 million years earlier. The
	analysis suggests that typical data sets contain useful information
	about the ancestral population sizes and that it is advantageous

	In particular, model-based clustering assumes that the data is generated
	by a finite mixture of underlying probability distributions such
	as multivariate normal distributions. The issues of selecting a 'good'
	clustering method and determining the 'correct' number of clusters
	are reduced to model selection problems in the probability framework.
	Gaussian mixture models have been shown to be a powerful tool for
	clustering in many applications. RESULTS: We benchmarked the performance
	of model-based clustering on several synthetic and real gene expression
	data sets for which external evaluation criteria were available.
	The model-based approach has superior performance on our synthetic
	data sets, consistently selecting the correct model and the number
	of clusters. On real expression data, the model-based approach produced
	clusters of quality comparable to a leading heuristic clustering
	algorithm, but with the key advantage of suggesting the number of
	clusters and an appropriate model. We also explored the validity
	of the Gaussian mixture assumption on different transformations of
	real data. We also assessed the degree to which these real gene expression
	data sets fit multivariate Gaussian distributions both before and

	are nearby in protein tertiary structure. A third possibility is
	that the amount of clustering exceeds that which can be explained

	spatially clustered replacement rates. We introduce two simple and

	this study we sequenced 50 noncoding, nonrepetitive DNA segments
	randomly chosen from the nuclear genome in 9 bonobos and 17 chimpanzees.
	Surprisingly, the pi value for bonobos is only 0.078\%, even somewhat
	lower than that (0.088\%) for humans for the same 50 segments. The
	pi values are 0.092, 0.130, and 0.082\% for East, Central, and West
	African chimpanzees, respectively, and 0.132\% for all chimpanzees.
	These values are similar to or at most only 1.5 times higher than
	that for humans. The much larger difference in mtDNA diversity than
	in nuclear DNA diversity between humans and chimpanzees is puzzling.
	We speculate that it is due mainly to a reduction in effective population
	size (N(e)) in the human lineage after the human-chimpanzee divergence,
	because a reduction in N(e) has a stronger effect on mtDNA diversity
	than on nuclear DNA diversity. Sequence data from this article have
	been deposited with the GenBank Data libraries under accession nos.

  abstract = {DNA barcoding as a method for species identification is rapidly increasing
	in popularity. However, there are still relatively few rigorous methodological
	tests of DNA barcoding. Current distance-based methods are frequently
	criticized for treating the nearest neighbor as the closest relative
	via a raw similarity score, lacking an objective set of criteria
	to delineate taxa, or for being incongruent with classical character-based
	taxonomy. Here, we propose an artificial intelligence-based approach
	- inferring species membership via DNA barcoding with back-propagation
	neural networks (named BP-based species identification) - as a new
	advance to the spectrum of available methods. We demonstrate the
	value of this approach with simulated data sets representing different
	levels of sequence variation under coalescent simulations with various
	evolutionary models, as well as with two empirical data sets of COI
	sequences from East Asian ground beetles (Carabidae) and Costa Rican
	skipper butterflies. With a 630-to 690-bp fragment of the COI gene,
	we identified 97.50\% of 80 unknown sequences of ground beetles,
	95.63\%, 96.10\%, and 100\% of 275, 205, and 9 unknown sequences
	of the neotropical skipper butterfly to their correct species, respectively.
	Our simulation studies indicate that the success rates of species
	identification depend on the divergence of sequences, the length
	of sequences, and the number of reference sequences. Particularly
	in cases involving incomplete lineage sorting, this new BP-based
	method appears to be superior to commonly used methods for DNA-based
	species identification.},

  abstract = {When a microsatellite locus is duplicated in a diploid organism, a
	single pair of PCR primers may amplify as many as four distinct alleles.
	To study the evolution of a duplicated microsatellite, we consider
	a coalescent model with symmetric stepwise mutation. Conditional
	on the time of duplication and a mutation rate, both in a model of
	completely unlinked loci and in a model of completely linked loci,
	we compute the probabilities for a sampled diploid individual to
	amplify one, two, three, or four distinct alleles with one pair of
	microsatellite PCR primers. These probabilities are then studied
	to examine the nature of their dependence on the duplication time
	and the mutation rate. The mutation rate is observed to have a stronger
	effect than the duplication time on the four probabilities, and the
	unlinked and linked cases are seen to behave similarly. Our results
	can be useful for helping to interpret genetic variation at microsatellite
	loci in species with a very recent history of gene and genome duplication.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: When analyzing protein sequences using sequence similarity
	searches, orthologous sequences (that diverged by speciation) are
	more reliable predictors of a new protein's function than paralogous
	sequences (that diverged by gene duplication), because duplication
	enables functional diversification. The utility of phylogenetic information
	in high-throughput genome annotation ('phylogenomics') is widely
	recognized, but existing approaches are either manual or indirect
	(e.g. not based on phylogenetic trees). Our goal is to automate phylogenomics
	using explicit phylogenetic inference. A necessary component is an
	algorithm to infer speciation and duplication events in a given gene
	tree. RESULTS: We give an algorithm to infer speciation and duplication
	events on a gene tree by comparison to a trusted species tree. This
	algorithm has a worst-case running time of O(n(2)) which is inferior
	to two previous algorithms that are approximately O(n) for a gene
	tree of sequences. However, our algorithm is extremely simple, and
	its asymptotic worst case behavior is only realized on pathological
	data sets. We show empirically, using 1750 gene trees constructed
	from the Pfam protein family database, that it appears to be a practical

	obtained follow the gamma distribution and, in Drosophila, are positively
	correlated with the molecular weights of the enzymes subunits. The
	variance in mutation rate is larger under the step-wise model of
	electrophoretic mutation than under the infinite-alleles model. Rates
	for the most variable loci may exceed rates for less variable loci
	by a factor of 500. For completely invariant loci, this factor may
	be as high as 4 X 10(4), an observation suggesting that these loci
	are subject to purifying selection. In contrast to mutation rates,
	effective population sizes may vary at the most by a factor of ten.
	These results support the hypothesis that differences in the amount
	of electrophoretic variability among polymorphic loci may reflect
	differences in the rate by which electrophoretically detectable variation
	is generated in population.},
