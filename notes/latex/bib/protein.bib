  abstract = {Cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COII), encoded by the mitochondrial
	genome, exhibits one of the most heterogeneous rates of amino acid
	replacement among placental mammals. Moreover, it has been demonstrated
	that cytochrome c oxidase has undergone a structural change in higher
	primates which has altered its physical interaction with cytochrome
	c. We collected a large data set of COII sequences from several orders
	of mammals with emphasis on primates, rodents, and artiodactyls.
	Using phylogenetic hypotheses based on data independent of the COII
	gene, we demonstrated that an increased number of amino acid replacements
	are concentrated among higher primates. Incorporating approximate
	divergence dates derived from the fossil record, we find that most
	of the change occurred independently along the New World monkey lineage
	and in a rapid burst before apes and Old World monkeys diverged.
	There is some evidence that Old World monkeys have undergone a faster
	rate of nonsynonymous substitution than have apes. Rates of substitution
	at four-fold degenerate sites in primates are relatively homogeneous,
	indicating that the rate heterogeneity is restricted to nondegenerate
	sites. Excluding the rate acceleration mentioned above, primates,
	rodents, and artiodactyls have remarkably similar nonsynonymous replacement
	rates. A different pattern is observed for transversions at four-fold
	degenerate sites, for which rodents exhibit a higher rate of replacement
	than do primates and artiodactyls. Finally, we hypothesize specific
	amino acid replacements which may account for much of the structural
	difference in cytochrome c oxidase between higher primates and other
	mammals.},

  abstract = {To explain why informational genes (i.e., those involved in transcription,

	the complexity hypothesis. The underlying idea is that informational
	genes belong to large, complex systems of coevolving genes. Consequently,
	the likelihood of the successful horizontal transfer of a single
	gene from such an integrated system is expected to be low. Here,
	this hypothesis is extended to explain some of the determinants of
	the mode of evolution of coding sequences. It is proposed that genes
	belonging to complex systems are relatively less likely to be under
	adaptive evolution. To evaluate this "extended complexity hypothesis,"
	2,428 families and protein domains were analyzed. This analysis found
	that genes whose products are highly connected, located in intracellular
	components, and involved in complex processes and functions were
	more conserved and less likely to be under adaptive evolution than
	are other gene products. The extended complexity hypothesis suggests
	that both the mode and the rate of evolution of a protein are influenced

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contradicting evidence has been presented in the literature
	concerning the effectiveness of empirical contact energies for fold
	recognition. Empirical contact energies are calculated on the basis
	of information available from selected protein structures, with respect
	to a defined reference state, according to the quasi-chemical approximation.
	Protein-solvent interactions are estimated from residue solvent accessibility.
	RESULTS: In the approach presented here, contact energies are derived
	from the potential of mean force theory, several definitions of contact
	are examined and their performance in fold recognition is evaluated
	on sets of decoy structures. The best definition of contact is tested,
	on a more realistic scenario, on all predictions including sidechains
	accepted in the CASP4 experiment. In 30 out of 35 cases the native
	structure is correctly recognized and best predictions are usually
	found among the 10 lowest energy predictions. CONCLUSION: The definition
	of contact based on van der Waals radii of alpha carbon and side
	chain heavy atoms is seen to perform better than other definitions
	involving only alpha carbons, only beta carbons, all heavy atoms
	or only backbone atoms. An important prerequisite for the applicability
	of the approach is that the protein structure under study should
	not exhibit anomalous solvent accessibility, compared to soluble
	proteins whose structure is deposited in the Protein Data Bank. The
	combined evaluation of a solvent accessibility parameter and contact
	energy allows for an effective gross screening of predictive models.},

	A strong and significant correlation between a protein's number of

	from some studies. The extremely low agreement between different
	protein interaction data sets indicates that interaction data are
	still of low coverage and/or quality. These limitations may explain

  abstract = {Mutagenesis of protein-encoding sequences occurs ubiquitously; it

	evolve novel proteins. To quantitate protein tolerance to random
	change, it is vital to understand the probability that a random amino
	acid replacement will lead to a protein's functional inactivation.
	We define this probability as the "x factor." Here, we develop a
	broadly applicable approach to calculate x factors and demonstrate
	this method using the human DNA repair enzyme 3-methyladenine DNA
	glycosylase (AAG). Three gene-wide mutagenesis libraries were created,
	each with 10(5) diversity and averaging 2.2, 4.6, and 6.2 random
	amino acid changes per mutant. After determining the percentage of
	functional mutants in each library using high-stringency selection
	(>19,000-fold), the x factor was found to be 34\% +/- 6\%. Remarkably,
	reanalysis of data from studies of diverse proteins reveals similar
	inactivation probabilities. To delineate the nature of tolerated
	amino acid substitutions, we sequenced 244 surviving AAG mutants.
	The 920 tolerated substitutions were characterized by substitutability
	index and mapped onto the AAG primary, secondary, and known tertiary
	structures. Evolutionarily conserved residues show low substitutability
	indices. In AAG, beta strands are on average less substitutable than
	alpha helices; and surface loops that are not involved in DNA binding
	are the most substitutable. Our results are relevant to such diverse
	topics as applied molecular evolution, the rate of introduction of
	deleterious alleles into genomes in evolutionary history, and organisms'
	tolerance of mutational burden.},

	The presence of a canonical CTD generally is correlated with the

	linked to conservation of the CTD. General rates of evolution, phylogenetic
	patterns, and the conservation of modeled tertiary structure of capping

	for this prediction is that relatively dispensable proteins should

	mildly deleterious substitutions more rapidly. Although this argument
	was presented over twenty years ago, and is fundamental to many applications
	of evolutionary theory, the prediction has proved difficult to confirm.
	In fact, a recent study showed that essential mouse genes do not
	evolve more slowly than non-essential ones. Thus, although a variety
	of factors influencing the rate of protein evolution have been supported
	by extensive sequence analysis, the relationship between protein
	dispensability and evolutionary rate has remained unconfirmed. Here
	we use the results from a highly parallel growth assay of single

	reveals a highly significant relationship between protein dispensability

	the theories are hard to confirm experimentally. The only correlation

	seem to evolve at a lower rate. Consequently, it has been suggested
	that correlations between evolution rate and factors like protein

	be just secondary effects due to differences in expression. The purpose

	We find weak, but significant, correlations between evolution rates

	that allows ascertainment of such questionable scenarios by taking

	(ATCase) as a case study. Prokaryotic ATCases correspond to different
	classes of quaternary structures according to the mode of association
	of the catalytic PyrB subunit with other polypeptides, either the
	PyrI regulatory subunit (class B) or a dihydroorotase (class A),
	which may be active (PyrC, subclass A1) or inactive (PyrC', subclass
	A2). Class C is uniquely made up of trimers of PyrB. The PyrB phylogenetic
	tree is not congruent with the tree of life, but it became coherent
	when we recognized the existence of two families of ATCases, ATC
	I and ATC II. Remarkably, a very strong correlation was found between
	the pattern of PyrB phylogenetic clustering and the different classes
	of quaternary structures of ATCases. All class B ATCases form a clade
	in family ATC II, which also contains all eukaryotic sequences. In
	contrast, family ATC I is made up of classes A and C. These results
	suggest unexpected common ancestry for prokaryotic B and eukaryotic
	ATCases on the one hand, and for A and C on the other. Thus, the

	a more recent event than the separation into the ATC I and ATC II

	on the identity of the partners interacting in the different kinds
	of holoenzymes, operated in a concerted way on the ancestral pyrB
	genes and the respective associated genes pyrI or pyrC, so as to
	maintain appropriate inter-polypeptides interactions at the level

	divergence is positively coupled with both gene expression polymorphism
	and divergence. We show moreover that although the number of protein-protein
	interactions in Drosophila is negatively associated with protein
	divergence as well as gene expression polymorphism and divergence,
	protein-protein interactions cannot account for the observed coupling
	between regulatory and structural evolution. Furthermore, we show
	that proteins with higher rates of amino acid substitutions tend
	to have larger sizes and tend to be expressed at lower mRNA abundances,
	whereas genes with higher levels of gene expression divergence and
	polymorphism tend to have shorter sizes and tend to be expressed
	at higher mRNA abundances. Finally, we show that protein length is
	negatively associated with both number of protein-protein interactions
	and mRNA abundance and that interacting proteins in Drosophila show
	similar amounts of divergence. We suggest that protein sequences
	and gene expression are subjected to similar evolutionary dynamics,
	possibly because of similarity in the fitness effect (i.e., strength
	of stabilizing selection) of disruptions in a gene's protein sequence

	that the evolutionary rate of a given position is not always constant
	throughout time. We called such within-site rate variations heterotachy
	(for "different speed" in Greek). Yet, heterotachy was found among
	homologous sequences of distantly related organisms, often with different
	functions. In such cases, the functional constraints are likely different,
	which would explain the different distribution of variable sites.
	To evaluate the importance of heterotachy, we focused on amino acid
	sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome b, for which the function is
	likely the same in all vertebrates. Using 2,038 sequences, we demonstrate
	that 95\% of the variable positions are heterotachous, i.e., underwent
	dramatic variations of substitution rate among vertebrate lineages.
	Heterotachy even occurs at small evolutionary scale, and in these
	cases it is very unlikely to be related to functional changes. Since
	a large number of sequences are required to efficiently detect heterotachy,
	the extent of this phenomenon could not be estimated for all proteins

	Such across-partition quantities include the distribution from which

  abstract = {What are the major forces governing protein evolution? A common view
	is that proteins with strong structural and functional requirements
	evolve more slowly than proteins with weak constraints, because a
	stringent negative selection pressure limits the number of substitutions.
	In contrast, Graur claimed that the substitution rate of a protein
	is mainly determined by its amino acid composition and the changeabilities
	of amino acids. In this paper, however, we found that the relative
	changeabilities of amino acids in mammalian proteins are different
	for transmembranal and nontransmembranal segments, which have very
	distinct structural requirements. This indicates that the changeability
	of a given residue is influenced by the structural and functional
	context. We also reexamined the relationship between substitution
	rate and amino acid composition. Indeed, the two kinds of segments
	exhibit contrasting amino acid compositions: transmembranal regions
	are made up mainly of hydrophobic residues (a total frequency of
	approximately 60\%) and are very poor in polar amino acids (<5\%),
	whereas nontransmembranal segments have frequencies of 30\% and 22\%,
	respectively. Interestingly, we found that within a given integral
	membrane protein, nontransmembranal segments accumulate, on average,
	twice as many substitutions as transmembranal regions. However, regression
	analyses showed that the variability in amino acid frequencies among
	proteins cannot explain more than 30\% of the variability in substitution
	rate for the transmembranal and nontransmembranal data sets. Furthermore,
	transmembranal and nontransmembranal segments evolving at the same
	rate in different proteins have different compositions, and the compositions
	of slowly evolving and rapidly evolving segments of the same type
	are similar. From these observations, we conclude that the rate of

  abstract = {The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that important
	proteins evolve more slowly than unimportant ones. High-throughput
	gene-knockout experiments in model organisms have provided information
	on the dispensability, and therefore importance, of thousands of
	proteins in a genome. However, previous studies of the correlation
	between protein dispensability and evolutionary rate were equivocal,
	and it has been proposed that the observed correlation is due to
	the covariation with the level of gene expression or is limited to
	duplicate genes. We here analyzed the gene dispensability data of
	the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and estimated protein evolutionary
	rates by comparing S. cerevisiae with nine species of varying degrees
	of divergence from S. cerevisiae. The correlation between gene dispensability
	and evolutionary rate, although low, is highly significant, even
	when the gene expression level is controlled for or when duplicate
	genes are excluded. Our results thus support the hypothesis of lower
	evolution rates for more important proteins, a widely used principle
	in the daily practice of molecular biology. When the evolutionary
	rate is estimated from closely related species, the ratio between
	the mean rate of nonessential proteins to that of essential proteins
	is 1.4. This ratio declines to 1.1 when the evolutionary rate is
	estimated from distantly related species, suggesting that the importance
	of a protein may change in evolution, so the dispensability data
	obtained from a model organism only predicts a short-term rate of
	protein evolution. A comparison of the fitness contributions of orthologous
	genes in yeast and nematode supports this conclusion.},
