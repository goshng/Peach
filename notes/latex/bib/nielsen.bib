  abstract = {This article presents an efficient importance-sampling method for
	computing the likelihood of the effective size of a population under
	the coalescent model of Berthier et al. Previous computational approaches,
	using Markov chain Monte Carlo, required many minutes to several
	hours to analyze small data sets. The approach presented here is
	orders of magnitude faster and can provide an approximation to the
	likelihood curve, even for large data sets, in a matter of seconds.
	Additionally, confidence intervals on the estimated likelihood curve
	provide a useful estimate of the Monte Carlo error. Simulations show
	the importance sampling to be stable across a wide range of scenarios
	and show that the N(e) estimator itself performs well. Further simulations
	show that the 95\% confidence intervals around the N(e) estimate
	are accurate. User-friendly software implementing the algorithm for
	Mac, Windows, and Unix/Linux is available for download. Applications
	of this computational framework to other problems are discussed.},

  abstract = {A new genetic estimator of the effective population size (N(e)) is
	introduced. This likelihood-based (LB) estimator uses two temporally
	spaced genetic samples of individuals from a population. We compared
	its performance to that of the classical F-statistic-based N(e) estimator
	(N(eFk)) by using data from simulated populations with known N(e)
	and real populations. The new likelihood-based estimator (N(eLB))
	showed narrower credible intervals and greater accuracy than (N(eFk))
	when genetic drift was strong, but performed only slightly better
	when genetic drift was relatively weak. When drift was strong (e.g.,
	N(e) = 20 for five generations), as few as approximately 10 loci
	(heterozygosity of 0.6; samples of 30 individuals) are sufficient
	to consistently achieve credible intervals with an upper limit <50
	using the LB method. In contrast, approximately 20 loci are required
	for the same precision when using the classical F-statistic approach.
	The N(eLB) estimator is much improved over the classical method when
	there are many rare alleles. It will be especially useful in conservation
	biology because it less often overestimates N(e) than does N(eLB)
	and thus is less likely to erroneously suggest that a population
	is large and has a low extinction risk.},

  abstract = {When a beneficial mutation is fixed in a population that lacks recombination,
	the genetic background linked to that mutation is fixed. As a result,
	beneficial mutations on different backgrounds experience competition,
	or "clonal interference," that can cause asexual populations to evolve
	more slowly than their sexual counterparts. Factors such as a large
	population size (N) and high mutation rates (mu) increase the number
	of competing beneficial mutations, and hence are expected to increase
	the intensity of clonal interference. However, recent theory suggests
	that, with very large values of Nmu, the severity of clonal interference
	may instead decline. The reason is that, with large Nmu, genomes
	including both beneficial mutations are rapidly created by recurrent
	mutation, obviating the need for recombination. Here, we analyze
	data from experimentally evolved asexual populations of a bacteriophage
	and find that, in these nonrecombining populations with very large
	Nmu, recurrent mutation does appear to ameliorate this cost of asexuality.},

  abstract = {A pseudo maximum likelihood method is proposed to estimate effective
	population size (Ne) using temporal changes in allele frequencies
	at multi-allelic loci. The computation is simplified dramatically
	by (1) approximating the multi-dimensional joint probabilities of
	all the data by the product of marginal probabilities (hence the
	name pseudo-likelihood), (2) exploiting the special properties of
	transition matrix and (3) using a hidden Markov chain algorithm.
	Simulations show that the pseudo-likelihood method has a similar
	performance but needs much less computing time and storage compared
	with the full likelihood method in the case of 3 alleles per locus.
	Due to computational developments, I was able to assess the performance
	of the pseudo-likelihood method against the F-statistic method over
	a wide range of parameters by extensive simulations. It is shown
	that the pseudo-likelihood method gives more accurate and precise
	estimates of Ne than the F-statistic method, and the performance
	difference is mainly due to the presence of rare alleles in the samples.
	The pseudo-likelihood method is also flexible and can use three or
	more temporal samples simultaneously to estimate satisfactorily the
	NeS of each period, or the growth parameters of the population. The
	accuracy and precision of both methods depend on the ratio of the
	product of sample size and the number of generations involved to
	Ne, and the number of independent alleles used. In an application
	of the pseudo-likelihood method to a large data set of an olive fly
	population, more precise estimates of Ne are obtained than those
