  abstract = {The correlation between alleles at a pair of genetic loci is a measure
	of linkage disequilibrium. The square of the sample correlation multiplied
	by sample size provides the usual test statistic for the hypothesis
	of no disequilibrium for loci with two alleles and this relation
	has proved useful for study design and marker selection. Nevertheless,
	this relation holds only in a diallelic case, and an extension to
	multiple alleles has not been made. Here we introduce a similar statistic,
	R2, which leads to a correlation-based test for loci with multiple
	alleles: for a pair of loci with k and m alleles, and a sample of
	n individuals, the approximate distribution of n(k - 1)(m - 1)/(km)R2
	under independence between loci is chi2(k-1(m-1). One advantage of
	this statistic is that it can be interpreted as the total correlation
	between a pair of loci. When the phase of two-locus genotypes is
	known, the approach is equivalent to a test for the overall correlation
	between rows and columns in a contingency table. In the phase-known
	case, R2 is the sum of the squared sample correlations for all km
	2 x 2 subtables formed by collapsing to one allele vs. the rest at
	each locus. We examine the approximate distribution under the null
	of independence for R2 and report its close agreement with the exact
	distribution obtained by permutation. The test for independence using
	R2 is a strong competitor to approaches such as Pearson's chi square,
	Fisher's exact test, and a test based on Cressie and Read's power
	divergence statistic. We combine this approach with our previous
	composite-disequilibrium measures to address the case when the genotypic
	phase is unknown. Calculation of the new multiallele test statistic
	and its P-value is very simple and utilizes the approximate distribution
	of R2. We provide a computer program that evaluates approximate as
	well as "exact" permutational P-values.},
