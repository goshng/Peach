  abstract = {Speciation is a process in which genetic drift and selection cause
	divergence over time. However, there is no rule dictating the time
	required for speciation, and even low levels of gene flow hinder
	divergence, so that taxa may be poised at the threshold of speciation
	for long periods of evolutionary time. We sequenced mitochondrial
	DNA (mtDNA) and eight nuclear introns (nuDNA) to estimate genomic
	levels of differentiation and gene flow between the Eurasian common
	teal (Anas crecca crecca) and the North American green-winged teal
	(Anas crecca carolinensis). These ducks come into contact in Beringia
	(north-eastern Asia and north-western North America) and have probably
	done so, perhaps cyclically, since the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition,
	~2.6 Ma, when they apparently began diverging. They have diagnosable
	differences in male plumage and are 6.9\% divergent in the mtDNA
	control region, with only 1 of 58 crecca and 2 of 86 carolinensis
	having haplotypes grouping with the other. Two nuclear loci were
	likewise strongly structured between these teal (?(st) ? 0.35), but
	six loci were undifferentiated or only weakly structured (?(st) =
	0.0-0.06). Gene flow between crecca and carolinensis was ~1 individual
	per generation in both directions in mtDNA, but was asymmetrical
	in nuDNA, with ~1 and ~20 individuals per generation immigrating
	into crecca and carolinensis, respectively. This study illustrates
	that species delimitation using a single marker oversimplifies the
	complexity of the speciation process, and it suggests that even with
	divergent selection, moderate levels of gene flow may stall the speciation
	process short of completion.},
