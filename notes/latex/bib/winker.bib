  title = {Is a new and general theory of molecular systematics emerging?},

  abstract = {The advent and maturation of algorithms for estimating species trees-phylogenetic
	trees that allow gene tree heterogeneity and whose tips represent
	lineages, populations and species, as opposed to genes-represent
	an exciting confluence of phylogenetics, phylogeography, and population
	genetics, and ushers in a new generation of concepts and challenges
	for the molecular systematist. In this essay I argue that to better
	deal with the large multilocus datasets brought on by phylogenomics,
	and to better align the fields of phylogeography and phylogenetics,
	we should embrace the primacy of species trees, not only as a new
	and useful practical tool for systematics, but also as a long-standing
	conceptual goal of systematics that, largely due to the lack of appropriate
	computational tools, has been eclipsed in the past few decades. I
	suggest that phylogenies as gene trees are a "local optimum" for
	systematics, and review recent advances that will bring us to the
	broader optimum inherent in species trees. In addition to adopting
	new methods of phylogenetic analysis (and ideally reserving the term
	"phylogeny" for species trees rather than gene trees), the new paradigm
	suggests shifts in a number of practices, such as sampling data to
	maximize not only the number of accumulated sites but also the number
	of independently segregating genes; routinely using coalescent or
	other models in computer simulations to allow gene tree heterogeneity;
	and understanding better the role of concatenation in influencing
	topologies and confidence in phylogenies. By building on the foundation
	laid by concepts of gene trees and coalescent theory, and by taking
	cues from recent trends in multilocus phylogeography, molecular systematics
	stands to be enriched. Many of the challenges and lessons learned
	for estimating gene trees will carry over to the challenge of estimating
	species trees, although adopting the species tree paradigm will clarify
	many issues (such as the nature of polytomies and the star tree paradox),
	raise conceptually new challenges, or provide new answers to old
	questions.},

  abstract = {Speciation is a process in which genetic drift and selection cause
	divergence over time. However, there is no rule dictating the time
	required for speciation, and even low levels of gene flow hinder
	divergence, so that taxa may be poised at the threshold of speciation
	for long periods of evolutionary time. We sequenced mitochondrial
	DNA (mtDNA) and eight nuclear introns (nuDNA) to estimate genomic
	levels of differentiation and gene flow between the Eurasian common
	teal (Anas crecca crecca) and the North American green-winged teal
	(Anas crecca carolinensis). These ducks come into contact in Beringia
	(north-eastern Asia and north-western North America) and have probably
	done so, perhaps cyclically, since the Pliocene-Pleistocene transition,
	~2.6 Ma, when they apparently began diverging. They have diagnosable
	differences in male plumage and are 6.9\% divergent in the mtDNA
	control region, with only 1 of 58 crecca and 2 of 86 carolinensis
	having haplotypes grouping with the other. Two nuclear loci were
	likewise strongly structured between these teal (?(st) ? 0.35), but
	six loci were undifferentiated or only weakly structured (?(st) =
	0.0-0.06). Gene flow between crecca and carolinensis was ~1 individual
	per generation in both directions in mtDNA, but was asymmetrical
	in nuDNA, with ~1 and ~20 individuals per generation immigrating
	into crecca and carolinensis, respectively. This study illustrates
	that species delimitation using a single marker oversimplifies the
	complexity of the speciation process, and it suggests that even with
	divergent selection, moderate levels of gene flow may stall the speciation
	process short of completion.},
