  title = {Insertions and the emergence of novel protein structure: a structure-based
	phylogenetic study of insertions.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In protein evolution, the mechanism of the emergence of
	novel protein domain is still an open question. The incremental growth
	of protein variable regions, which was produced by stochastic insertions,
	has the potential to generate large and complex sub-structures. In
	this study, a deterministic methodology is proposed to reconstruct
	phylogenies from protein structures, and to infer insertion events
	in protein evolution. The analysis was performed on a broad range
	of SCOP domain families. RESULTS: Phylogenies were reconstructed
	from protein 3D structural data. The phylogenetic trees were used
	to infer ancestral structures with a consensus method. From these
	ancestral reconstructions, 42.7\% of the observed insertions are
	nested insertions, which locate in previous insert regions. The average
	size of inserts tends to increase with the insert rank or total number
	of insertions in the variable regions. We found that the structures
	of some nested inserts show complex or even domain-like fold patterns
	with helices, strands and loops. Furthermore, a basal level of structural
	innovation was found in inserts which displayed a significant structural
	similarity exclusively to themselves. The beta-Lactamase/D-ala carboxypeptidase
	domain family is provided as an example to illustrate the inference
	of insertion events, and how the incremental growth of a variable
	region is capable to generate novel structural patterns. CONCLUSION:
	Using 3D data, we proposed a method to reconstruct phylogenies. We
	applied the method to reconstruct the sequences of insertion events
	leading to the emergence of potentially novel structural elements
	within existing protein domains. The results suggest that structural
	innovation is possible via the stochastic process of insertions and
	rapid evolution within variable regions where inserts tend to be
	nested. We also demonstrate that the structure-based phylogeny enables
	the study of new questions relating to the evolution of protein domain
	and biological function.},

  title = {A maximum likelihood framework for protein design.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {326},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of protein design is to predict amino-acid sequences
	compatible with a given target structure. Traditionally envisioned
	as a purely thermodynamic question, this problem can also be understood
	in a wider context, where additional constraints are captured by
	learning the sequence patterns displayed by natural proteins of known
	conformation. In this latter perspective, however, we still need
	a theoretical formalization of the question, leading to general and
	efficient learning methods, and allowing for the selection of fast
	and accurate objective functions quantifying sequence/structure compatibility.
	RESULTS: We propose a formulation of the protein design problem in
	terms of model-based statistical inference. Our framework uses the
	maximum likelihood principle to optimize the unknown parameters of
	a statistical potential, which we call an inverse potential to contrast
	with classical potentials used for structure prediction. We propose
	an implementation based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, in which the
	likelihood is maximized by gradient descent and is numerically estimated
	by thermodynamic integration. The fit of the models is evaluated
	by cross-validation. We apply this to a simple pairwise contact potential,
	supplemented with a solvent-accessibility term, and show that the
	resulting models have a better predictive power than currently available
	pairwise potentials. Furthermore, the model comparison method presented
	here allows one to measure the relative contribution of each component
	of the potential, and to choose the optimal number of accessibility
	classes, which turns out to be much higher than classically considered.
	CONCLUSION: Altogether, this reformulation makes it possible to test
	a wide diversity of models, using different forms of potentials,
	or accounting for other factors than just the constraint of thermodynamic
	stability. Ultimately, such model-based statistical analyses may
	help to understand the forces shaping protein sequences, and driving
	their evolution.},

  abstract = {Standard likelihood-based frameworks in phylogenetics consider the
	process of evolution of a sequence site by site. Assuming that sites
	evolve independently greatly simplifies the required calculations.
	However, this simplification is known to be incorrect in many cases.
	Here, a computational method that allows for general dependence between
	sites of a sequence is investigated. Using this method, measures
	acting as sequence fitness proxies can be considered over a phylogenetic
	tree. In this work, a set of statistically derived amino acid pairwise
	potentials, developed in the context of protein threading, is used
	to account for what we call the structural fitness of a sequence.
	We describe a model combining statistical potentials with an empirical
	amino acid substitution matrix. We propose such a combination as
	a useful way of capturing the complexity of protein evolution. Finally,
	we outline features of the model using three datasets and show the
	approach's sensitivity to different tree topologies.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the advent of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques,
	coupled with modern computational capabilities, has enabled the study
	of evolutionary models without a closed form solution of the likelihood
	function. However, current Bayesian MCMC applications can incur significant
	computational costs, as they are based on a full sampling from the
	posterior probability distribution of the parameters of interest.
	Here, we draw attention as to how MCMC techniques can be embedded
	within normal approximation strategies for more economical statistical
	computation. The overall procedure is based on an estimate of the
	first and second moments of the likelihood function, as well as a
	maximum likelihood estimate. Through examples, we review several
	MCMC-based methods used in the statistical literature for such estimation,
	applying the approaches to constructing posterior distributions under
	non-analytical evolutionary models relaxing the assumptions of rate
	homogeneity, and of independence between sites. Finally, we use the
	procedures for conducting Bayesian model selection, based on Laplace
	approximations of Bayes factors, which we find to be accurate and
	computationally advantageous. Altogether, the methods we expound
	here, as well as other related approaches from the statistical literature,
	should prove useful when investigating increasingly complex descriptions
	of molecular evolution, alleviating some of the difficulties associated
	with nonanalytical models.},

  number = {9},
  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {In recent works, methods have been proposed for applying phylogenetic
	models that allow for a general interdependence between the amino
	acid positions of a protein. As of yet, such models have focused
	on site interdependencies resulting from sequence-structure compatibility
	constraints, using simplified structural representations in combination
	with a set of statistical potentials. This structural compatibility
	criterion is meant as a proxy for sequence fitness, and the methods
	developed thus far can incorporate different site-interdependent
	fitness proxies based on other measurements. However, no methods
	have been proposed for comparing and evaluating the adequacy of alternative
	fitness proxies in this context, or for more general comparisons
	with canonical models of protein evolution. In the present work,
	we apply Bayesian methods of model selection-based on numerical calculations
	of marginal likelihoods and posterior predictive checks-to evaluate
	models encompassing the site-interdependent framework. Our application
	of these methods indicates that considering site-interdependencies,
	as done here, leads to an improved model fit for all data sets studied.
	Yet, we find that the use of pairwise contact potentials alone does
	not suitably account for across-site rate heterogeneity or amino
	acid exchange propensities; for such complexities, site-independent
	treatments are still called for. The most favored models combine
	the use of statistical potentials with a suitably rich site-independent
	model. Altogether, the methodology employed here should allow for
	a more rigorous and systematic exploration of different ways of modeling
	explicit structural constraints, or any other site-interdependent
	criterion, while best exploiting the richness of previously proposed
	models.},
