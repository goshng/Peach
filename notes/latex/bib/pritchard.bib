  abstract = {A plethora of statistical models have recently been developed to estimate
	components of population genetic history. Very few of these methods,
	however, have been adequately evaluated for their performance in
	accurately estimating population genetic parameters of interest.
	In this paper, we continue a research program of evaluation of population
	genetic methods through computer simulation. Specifically, we examine
	the software MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 and test the accuracy of this software
	to estimate genetic diversity (Theta), migration rates, and confidence
	intervals. We simulated nucleotide sequence data under a neutral
	coalescent model with lengths of 500 bp and 1000 bp, and with three
	different per site Theta values of (0.00025, 0.0025, 0.025) crossed
	with four different migration rates (0.0000025, 0.025, 0.25, 2.5)
	to construct 1000 evolutionary trees per-combination per-sequence-length.
	We found that while MIGRATEE-N 1.6.8 performs reasonably well in
	estimating genetic diversity (Theta), it does poorly at estimating
	migration rates and the confidence intervals associated with them.
	We recommend researchers use this software with caution under conditions
	similar to those used in this evaluation.},

  abstract = {Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding
	factor in genetic association studies. Estimated ancestries, derived
	from multi-locus genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical
	correction for population stratification. One popular technique for
	estimation of ancestry is the model-based approach embodied by the
	widely applied program structure. Another approach, implemented in
	the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather
	than model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture
	fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to its
	remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We present a new algorithm
	and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of ancestry
	in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded
	in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving
	problems in minutes that take structure hours. In many of our experiments,
	we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The
	runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation
	scheme using sequential quadratic programming for block updates,
	coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of convergence. Our
	algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than the implementation
	of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the
	program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood
	estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral
	allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's Bayesian estimates.
	On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable
	to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together, our results
	show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed opens up the possibility
	of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation
	and that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population
	stratification in association studies.},

  volume = {18},
  pages = {4270--4282},
  number = {20},
  month = {Oct},
  abstract = {Data analysis in phylogeographic investigations is typically conducted
	in either a qualitative manner, or alternatively via the testing
	of null hypotheses. The former, where inferences about population
	processes are derived from geographical patterns of genetic variation,
	may be subject to confirmation bias and prone to overinterpretation.
	Testing the predictions of null hypotheses is arguably less prone
	to bias than qualitative approaches, but only if the tested hypotheses
	are biologically meaningful. As it is difficult to know a priori
	if this is the case, there is the general need for additional methodological
	approaches in phylogeographic research. Here, we explore an alternative
	method for analysing phylogeographic data that utilizes information
	theory to quantify the probability of multiple hypotheses given the
	data. We accomplish this by augmenting the model-selection procedure
	implemented in ima with calculations of Akaike Information Criterion
	scores and model probabilities. We generate a ranking of 17 models
	each representing a set of historical evolutionary processes that
	may have contributed to the evolution of Plethodon idahoensis, and
	then quantify the relative strength of support for each hypothesis
	given the data using metrics borrowed from information theory. Our
	results suggest that two models have high probability given the data.
	Each of these models includes population divergence and estimates
	of ancestral theta that differ from estimates of descendent theta,
	inferences consistent with prior work in this system. However, the
	models disagree in that one includes migration as a parameter and
	one does not, suggesting that there are two regions of parameter
	space that produce model likelihoods that are similar in magnitude
	given our data. Results of a simulation study suggest that when data
	are simulated with migration, most of the optimal models include
	migration as a parameter, and further that when all of the shared
	polymorphism results from incomplete lineage sorting, most of the
	optimal models do not. The results could also indicate a lack of
	precision, which may be a product of the amount of data that we have
	collected. In any case, the information-theoretic metrics that we
	have applied to the analysis of our data are statistically rigorous,
	as are hypothesis-testing approaches, but move beyond the 'reject/fail
	to reject' dichotomy of conventional hypothesis testing in a manner
	that provides considerably more flexibility to researchers.},

  title = {Enhanced Bayesian modelling in BAPS software for learning genetic
	structures of populations.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {539},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the most recent decade many Bayesian statistical
	models and software for answering questions related to the genetic
	structure underlying population samples have appeared in the scientific
	literature. Most of these methods utilize molecular markers for the
	inferences, while some are also capable of handling DNA sequence
	data. In a number of earlier works, we have introduced an array of
	statistical methods for population genetic inference that are implemented
	in the software BAPS. However, the complexity of biological problems
	related to genetic structure analysis keeps increasing such that
	in many cases the current methods may provide either inappropriate
	or insufficient solutions. RESULTS: We discuss the necessity of enhancing
	the statistical approaches to face the challenges posed by the ever-increasing
	amounts of molecular data generated by scientists over a wide range
	of research areas and introduce an array of new statistical tools
	implemented in the most recent version of BAPS. With these methods
	it is possible, e.g., to fit genetic mixture models using user-specified
	numbers of clusters and to estimate levels of admixture under a genetic
	linkage model. Also, alleles representing a different ancestry compared
	to the average observed genomic positions can be tracked for the
	sampled individuals, and a priori specified hypotheses about genetic
	population structure can be directly compared using Bayes' theorem.
	In general, we have improved further the computational characteristics
	of the algorithms behind the methods implemented in BAPS facilitating
	the analyses of large and complex datasets. In particular, analysis
	of a single dataset can now be spread over multiple computers using
	a script interface to the software. CONCLUSION: The Bayesian modelling
	methods introduced in this article represent an array of enhanced
	tools for learning the genetic structure of populations. Their implementations
	in the BAPS software are designed to meet the increasing need for
	analyzing large-scale population genetics data. The software is freely
	downloadable for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X systems at http://web.abo.fi/fak/mnf//mate/jc/software/baps.html.},

	be at Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium, but the allelic composition
	of these source populations and even the number of source populations

	of interest is the partition of the set of sampled individuals, induced
	by the assignment of individuals to source populations. We present
	a maximum likelihood method, and then a more powerful Bayesian approach
	for estimating this sample partition. In general, it will not be
	feasible to evaluate the evidence supporting each possible partition
	of the sample. Furthermore, when the number of individuals in the
	sample is large, it may not even be feasible to evaluate the evidence
	supporting, individually, each of the most plausible partitions because
	there may be many individuals which are difficult to assign. To overcome
	these problems, we use low-dimensional marginals (the 'co-assignment
	probabilities') of the posterior distribution of the sample partition
	as measures of 'similarity', and then apply a hierarchical clustering
	algorithm to identify clusters of individuals whose assignment together
	is well supported by the posterior distribution. A binary tree provides
	a visual representation of how well the posterior distribution supports

  abstract = {Nonrandom mating induces correlations in allelic states within and

	considerable interest to quantify the contribution of two forms of
	nonrandom mating to patterns of standing genetic variation: inbreeding
	(mating among relatives) and population substructure (limited dispersal
	of gametes). Here, we extend the popular Bayesian clustering approach
	STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al. 2000) for simultaneous inference of inbreeding
	or selfing rates and population-of-origin classification using multilocus
	genetic markers. This is accomplished by eliminating the assumption
	of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within clusters and, instead, calculating
	expected genotype frequencies on the basis of inbreeding or selfing
	rates. We demonstrate the need for such an extension by showing that
	selfing leads to spurious signals of population substructure using
	the standard STRUCTURE algorithm with a bias toward spurious signals
	of admixture. We gauge the performance of our method using extensive
	coalescent simulations and demonstrate that our approach can correct
	for this bias. We also apply our approach to understanding the population
	structure of the wild relative of domesticated rice, Oryza rufipogon,
	an important partially selfing grass species. Using a sample of n
	= 16 individuals sequenced at 111 random loci, we find strong evidence

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: In a series of recent papers, Tess, a computer program
	based on the concept of hidden Markov random field, has been proposed
	to infer the number and locations of panmictic population units from
	the genotypes and spatial locations of these individuals. The method
	seems to be of broad appeal as it is conceptually much simpler than
	other competing methods and it has been reported by its authors to
	be fast and accurate. However, this methodology is not grounded in
	a formal statistical inference method and seems to rely to a large
	extent on arbitrary choices regarding the parameters used. The present
	article is an investigation of the accuracy of this method and an
	attempt to assess whether recent results reported on the basis of
	this method are genuine features of the genetic process or artefacts
	of the method. Method: I analyse simulated data consisting of populations
	at Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium and also data simulated
	under a scenario of isolation-by-distance at mutation-migration-drift
	equilibrium. Arabidopsis thaliana data previously analysed with this
	method are also reconsidered. RESULTS: Using the Tess program under
	the no-admixture model to analyse data consisting of several genuine
	HWLE populations with individuals of pure ancestries leads to highly
	inaccurate results; Using the Tess program under the admixture model
	to analyse data consisting of a continuous isolation-by-distance
	population leads to the inference of spurious HWLE populations whose
	number and features depend on the parameters used. Results previously
	reported about the A.thaliana using Tess seem to a large extent to
	be artefacts of the statistical methodology used. The findings go
	beyond population clustering models and can be an help to design
	more efficient algorithms based on graphs. AVAILABILITY: The data

  abstract = {Landscape genetics is a new discipline that aims to provide information
	on how landscape and environmental features influence population
	genetic structure. The first key step of landscape genetics is the
	spatial detection and location of genetic discontinuities between
	populations. However, efficient methods for achieving this task are
	lacking. In this article, we first clarify what is conceptually involved
	in the spatial modeling of genetic data. Then we describe a Bayesian
	model implemented in a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme that allows
	inference of the location of such genetic discontinuities from individual
	geo-referenced multilocus genotypes, without a priori knowledge on
	populational units and limits. In this method, the global set of
	sampled individuals is modeled as a spatial mixture of panmictic
	populations, and the spatial organization of populations is modeled
	through the colored Voronoi tessellation. In addition to spatially
	locating genetic discontinuities, the method quantifies the amount
	of spatial dependence in the data set, estimates the number of populations
	in the studied area, assigns individuals to their population of origin,
	and detects individual migrants between populations, while taking
	into account uncertainty on the location of sampled individuals.
	The performance of the method is evaluated through the analysis of
	simulated data sets. Results show good performances for standard
	data sets (e.g., 100 individuals genotyped at 10 loci with 10 alleles

	the presence of intractable normalizing constants in Metropolis-Hastings

  abstract = {Eastern North America is one of at least six regions of the world
	where agriculture is thought to have arisen wholly independently.
	The primary evidence for this hypothesis derives from morphological
	changes in the archaeobotanical record of three important crops--squash,
	goosefoot and sunflower--as well as an extinct minor cultigen, sumpweed.
	However, the geographical origins of two of the three primary domesticates--squash
	and goosefoot--are now debated, and until recently sunflower (Helianthus
	annuus L.) has been considered the only undisputed eastern North
	American domesticate. The discovery of 4,000-year-old domesticated
	sunflower remains from San Andrés, Tabasco, implies an earlier and
	possibly independent origin of domestication in Mexico and has stimulated
	a re-examination of the geographical origin of domesticated sunflower.
	Here we describe the genetic relationships and pattern of genetic
	drift between extant domesticated strains and wild populations collected

  abstract = {Although the importance of selecting cases and controls from the same
	population has been recognized for decades, the recent advent of
	genome-wide association studies has heightened awareness of this
	issue. Because these studies typically deal with large samples, small
	differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls can
	easily reach statistical significance. When, unbeknownst to a researcher,
	cases and controls have different substructures, the number of false-positive
	findings is inflated. There have been three recent developments of
	purely statistical approaches to assessing the ancestral comparability
	of case and control samples: genomic control, structured association,
	and multivariate reduction analyses. The widespread use of high-throughput
	technology has allowed the quick and accurate genotyping of the large
	number of markers required by these methods. Group 13 dealt with
	four population stratification issues: single-nucleotide polymorphism
	marker selection, association testing, nonstandard methods, and linkage
	disequilibrium calculations in stratified or mixed ethnicity samples.
	We demonstrated that there are continuous axes of ethnic variation
	in both data sets of Genetic Analysis Workshop 16. Furthermore, ignoring
	this structure created P-value inflation for a variety of phenotypes.
	Principal-components analysis (or multidimensional scaling) can control
	inflation as covariates in a logistic regression. One can weigh for
	local ancestry estimation and allow the use of related individuals.
	Problems arise in the presence of extremely high association or unusually
	strong linkage disequilibrium (e.g., in chromosomal inversions).
	Our group also reported a method for performing an association test
	controlling for substructure, when genome-wide markers are not available,
	to explicitly compute stratification.},

  abstract = {Inferring population structure from genetic data sampled from some
	number of individuals is a formidable statistical problem. One widely
	used approach considers the number of populations to be fixed and
	calculates the posterior probability of assigning individuals to
	each population. More recently, the assignment of individuals to
	populations and the number of populations have both been considered
	random variables that follow a Dirichlet process prior. We examined
	the statistical behavior of assignment of individuals to populations
	under a Dirichlet process prior. First, we examined a best-case scenario,
	in which all of the assumptions of the Dirichlet process prior were
	satisfied, by generating data under a Dirichlet process prior. Second,
	we examined the performance of the method when the genetic data were
	generated under a population genetics model with symmetric migration
	between populations. We examined the accuracy of population assignment
	using a distance on partitions. The method can be quite accurate
	with a moderate number of loci. As expected, inferences on the number
	of populations are more accurate when theta = 4N(e)u is large and
	when the migration rate (4N(e)m) is low. We also examined the sensitivity
	of inferences of population structure to choice of the parameter
	of the Dirichlet process model. Although inferences could be sensitive
	to the choice of the prior on the number of populations, this sensitivity
	occurred when the number of loci sampled was small; inferences are
	more robust to the prior on the number of populations when the number
	of sampled loci is large. Finally, we discuss several methods for
	summarizing the results of a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
	analysis of population structure. We develop the notion of the mean
	population partition, which is the partition of individuals to populations
	that minimizes the squared partition distance to the partitions sampled
	by the MCMC algorithm.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-random patterns of genetic variation exist among individuals
	in a population owing to a variety of evolutionary factors. Therefore,
	populations are structured into genetically distinct subpopulations.
	As genotypic datasets become ever larger, it is increasingly difficult
	to correctly estimate the number of subpopulations and assign individuals
	to them. The computationally efficient non-parametric, chiefly Principal
	Components Analysis (PCA)-based methods are thus becoming increasingly
	relied upon for population structure analysis. Current PCA-based
	methods can accurately detect structure; however, the accuracy in
	resolving subpopulations and assigning individuals to them is wanting.
	When subpopulations are closely related to one another, they overlap
	in PCA space and appear as a conglomerate. This problem is exacerbated
	when some subpopulations in the dataset are genetically far removed
	from others. We propose a novel PCA-based framework which addresses
	this shortcoming. RESULTS: A novel population structure analysis
	algorithm called iterative pruning PCA (ipPCA) was developed which
	assigns individuals to subpopulations and infers the total number
	of subpopulations present. Genotypic data from simulated and real
	population datasets with different degrees of structure were analyzed.
	For datasets with simple structures, the subpopulation assignments
	of individuals made by ipPCA were largely consistent with the STRUCTURE,
	BAPS and AWclust algorithms. On the other hand, highly structured
	populations containing many closely related subpopulations could
	be accurately resolved only by ipPCA, and not by other methods. CONCLUSION:
	The algorithm is computationally efficient and not constrained by
	the dataset complexity. This systematic subpopulation assignment
	approach removes the need for prior population labels, which could
	be advantageous when cryptic stratification is encountered in datasets
	containing individuals otherwise assumed to belong to a homogenous
	population.},

	In population-genetic clustering algorithms, such as BAPS, STRUCTURE
	and TESS, individual multilocus genotypes are partitioned over a
	set of clusters, often using unsupervised approaches that involve
	stochastic simulation. As a result, replicate cluster analyses of
	the same data may produce several distinct solutions for estimated
	cluster membership coefficients, even though the same initial conditions
	were used. Major differences among clustering solutions have two
	main sources: (1) 'label switching' of clusters across replicates,
	caused by the arbitrary way in which clusters in an unsupervised
	analysis are labeled, and (2) 'genuine multimodality,' truly distinct
	solutions across replicates. RESULTS: To facilitate the interpretation
	of population-genetic clustering results, we describe three algorithms
	for aligning multiple replicate analyses of the same data set. We
	have implemented these algorithms in the computer program CLUMPP
	(CLUster Matching and Permutation Program). We illustrate the use
	of CLUMPP by aligning the cluster membership coefficients from 100
	replicate cluster analyses of 600 chickens from 20 different breeds.

  abstract = {DNA sequences extracted from ancient remains are increasingly used
	to generate large population data sets, often spanning tens of thousands
	of years of population history. Bayesian coalescent methods such
	as those implemented in the software package BEAST can be used to
	estimate the demographic history of these populations, sometimes
	resulting in complex scenarios of fluctuations in population size,
	which can be correlated with the timing of environmental events,
	such as glaciations. Recently, however, Axelsson et al. (Axelsson
	E, Willerslev E, Gilbert MTP, Nielsen R. 2008. The effect of ancient
	DNA damage on inferences of demographic histories. Mol Biol Evol
	25:2181-2187.) claimed that many of these complex demographic trends
	are likely to be the result of postmortem DNA damage, a problem that
	they investigate by removing all sites involving transitions from
	ancient sequences prior to analysis. When this solution is applied
	to a previously published data set of Pleistocene bison, they show
	that the demographic signal of population expansion and decline disappears.
	Although some apparently segregating mutations in ancient sequences
	may be due to postmortem damage, we argue that discarding the data
	will result in loss of power to detect patterns of population change.
	Instead, to accommodate this problem, we implement a model in which
	sequences are the result of a joint process of molecular evolution
	and postmortem DNA damage within a probabilistic inference framework.
	Through simulation, we demonstrate the ability of this model to accurately
	recover evolutionary parameters, demographic history, and DNA damage
	rates. When this model is applied to the bison data set, we find
	that the rate of DNA damage is significant but low and that the reconstruction
	of population size history is nearly identical to previously published
	estimates.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate inference of genetic discontinuities between
	populations is an essential component of intraspecific biodiversity
	and evolution studies, as well as associative genetics. The most
	widely-used methods to infer population structure are model-based,
	Bayesian MCMC procedures that minimize Hardy-Weinberg and linkage
	disequilibrium within subpopulations. These methods are useful, but
	suffer from large computational requirements and a dependence on
	modeling assumptions that may not be met in real data sets. Here
	we describe the development of a new approach, PCO-MC, which couples
	principal coordinate analysis to a clustering procedure for the inference
	of population structure from multilocus genotype data. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
	FINDINGS: PCO-MC uses data from all principal coordinate axes simultaneously
	to calculate a multidimensional "density landscape", from which the
	number of subpopulations, and the membership within subpopulations,
	is determined using a valley-seeking algorithm. Using extensive simulations,
	we show that this approach outperforms a Bayesian MCMC procedure
	when many loci (e.g. 100) are sampled, but that the Bayesian procedure
	is marginally superior with few loci (e.g. 10). When presented with
	sufficient data, PCO-MC accurately delineated subpopulations with
	population F(st) values as low as 0.03 (G'(st)>0.2), whereas the
	limit of resolution of the Bayesian approach was F(st) = 0.05 (G'(st)>0.35).
	CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We draw a distinction between population
	structure inference for describing biodiversity as opposed to Type
	I error control in associative genetics. We suggest that discrete
	assignments, like those produced by PCO-MC, are appropriate for circumscribing
	units of biodiversity whereas expression of population structure
	as a continuous variable is more useful for case-control correction
	in structured association studies.},

	multilocus genotypes from worldwide human populations produced genetic
	clusters largely coincident with major geographic regions. It has
	been argued, however, that the degree of clustering is diminished
	by use of samples with greater uniformity in geographic distribution,
	and that the clusters we identified were a consequence of uneven
	sampling along genetic clines. Expanding our earlier dataset from
	377 to 993 markers, we systematically examine the influence of several
	study design variables--sample size, number of loci, number of clusters,
	assumptions about correlations in allele frequencies across populations,
	and the geographic dispersion of the sample--on the "clusteredness"
	of individuals. With all other variables held constant, geographic
	dispersion is seen to have comparatively little effect on the degree
	of clustering. Examination of the relationship between genetic and
	geographic distance supports a view in which the clusters arise not
	as an artifact of the sampling scheme, but from small discontinuous
	jumps in genetic distance for most population pairs on opposite sides
	of geographic barriers, in comparison with genetic distance for pairs
	on the same side. Thus, analysis of the 993-locus dataset corroborates
	our earlier results: if enough markers are used with a sufficiently
	large worldwide sample, individuals can be partitioned into genetic
	clusters that match major geographic subdivisions of the globe, with
	some individuals from intermediate geographic locations having mixed
	membership in the clusters that correspond to neighboring regions.},
