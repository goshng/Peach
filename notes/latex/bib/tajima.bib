  abstract = {Simple statistical methods for testing the molecular evolutionary
	clock hypothesis are developed which can be applied to both nucleotide
	and amino acid sequences. These methods are based on the chi-square
	test and are applicable even when the pattern of substitution rates
	is unknown and/or the substitution rate varies among different sites.
	Furthermore, some of the methods can be applied even when the outgroup
	is unknown. Using computer simulations, these methods were compared
	with the likelihood ratio test and the relative rate test. The results
	indicate that the powers of the present methods are similar to those
	of the likelihood ratio test and the relative rate test, in spite
	of the fact that the latter two tests assume that the pattern of
	substitution rates follows a certain model and that the substitution
	rate is the same among different sites, while such assumptions are
	not necessary to apply the present methods. Therefore, the present
	methods might be useful.},
