  abstract = {Arabis alpina is a widespread plant of European arctic and alpine
	environments and belongs to the same family as Arabidopsis thaliana.
	It grows in all major mountain ranges within the Italian glacial
	refugia and populations were sampled over a 1300 km transect from
	Sicily to the Alps. Diversity was studied in nuclear and chloroplast
	genome markers, combining phylogeographical and population genetic
	approaches. Alpine populations had significantly lower levels of
	nuclear genetic variation compared to those in the Italian Peninsula,
	and this is associated with a pronounced change in within-population
	inbreeding. Alpine populations were significantly inbred (F(IS) =
	0.553), possibly reflecting a change to the self-incompatibility
	system during leading edge colonization. The Italian Peninsula populations
	were approaching Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (outbreeding, F(IS) =
	0.076) and genetic variation was highly structured, consistent with
	independent local 'refugia within refugia' and the fragmentation
	of an established population by Quaternary climate oscillations.
	There is very little evidence of genetic exchange between the Alps
	and the Italian Peninsula main distribution ranges. The Alps functioned
	as a glacial sink for A. alpina, while the Italian Peninsula remains
	a distinct and separate long-term refugium. Comparative analysis
	indicated that inbreeding populations probably recolonized the Alps
	twice: (i) during a recent postglacial colonization of the western
	Alps from a Maritime Alps refugium; and (ii) separately into the
	central Alps from a source outside the sampling range. The pronounced
	geographical structure and inbreeding discontinuities are significant
	for the future development of A. alpina as a model species.},

	in North America did we find a single multilocus haplotype shared

	event. Despite the occurrence of local inbreeding, a considerable
	amount of genetic variation was found segregating within and among
	local populations. A novel analysis of haplotype differences reveals
	that genetic differentiation occurs at every geographic scale in
	A. thaliana, where we find a surprising under-representation of recent
	migrants between local populations. This leads us to hypothesize
	that most dispersal between A. thaliana populations is by pollen
	rather than seed. Based on the structure of A. thaliana populations,
	it appears that regional groups of local populations may provide

  abstract = {The seven species of sea turtles occupy a diversity of niches, and
	have a history tracing back over 100 million years, yet all share
	basic life-history features, including exceptional navigation skills
	and periodic migrations from feeding to breeding habitats. Here,
	we review the biogeographic, behavioural, and ecological factors
	that shape the distribution of genetic diversity in sea turtles.
	Natal homing, wherein turtles return to their region of origin for
	mating and nesting, has been demonstrated with mtDNA sequences. These
	maternally inherited markers show strong population structure among
	nesting colonies while nuclear loci reveal a contrasting pattern
	of male-mediated gene flow, a phenomenon termed 'complex population
	structure'. Mixed-stock analyses indicate that multiple nesting colonies
	can contribute to feeding aggregates, such that exploitation of turtles
	in these habitats can reduce breeding populations across the region.
	The mtDNA data also demonstrate migrations across entire ocean basins,
	some of the longest movements of marine vertebrates. Multiple paternity
	occurs at reported rates of 0-100\%, and can vary by as much as 9-100\%
	within species. Hybridization in almost every combination among members
	of the Cheloniidae has been documented but the frequency and ultimate
	ramifications of hybridization are not clear. The global phylogeography
	of sea turtles reveals a gradient based on habitat preference and
	thermal regime. The cold-tolerant leatherback turtle (Dermochelys
	coriacea) shows no evolutionary partitions between Indo-Pacific and
	Atlantic populations, while the tropical green (Chelonia mydas),
	hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), and ridleys (Lepidochelys olivacea
	vs. L. kempi) have ancient separations between oceans. Ridleys and
	loggerhead (Caretta caretta) also show more recent colonization between
	ocean basins, probably mediated by warm-water gyres that occasionally
	traverse the frigid upwelling zone in southern Africa. These rare
	events may be sufficient to prevent allopatric speciation under contemporary
	geographic and climatic conditions. Genetic studies have advanced
	our understanding of marine turtle biology and evolution, but significant
	gaps persist and provide challenges for the next generation of sea
	turtle geneticists.},

  abstract = {Varroa destructor is a parasitic mite of the Eastern honeybee Apis
	cerana. Fifty years ago, two distinct evolutionary lineages (Korean
	and Japanese) invaded the Western honeybee Apis mellifera. This haplo-diploid
	parasite species reproduces mainly through brother-sister matings,
	a system which largely favors the fixation of new mutations. In a
	worldwide sample of 225 individuals from 21 locations collected on
	Western honeybees and analyzed at 19 microsatellite loci, a series
	of de novo mutations was observed. Using historical data concerning
	the invasion, this original biological system has been exploited
	to compare three mutation models with allele size constraints for
	microsatellite markers: stepwise (SMM) and generalized (GSM) mutation
	models, and a model with mutation rate increasing exponentially with
	microsatellite length (ESM). Posterior probabilities of the three
	models have been estimated for each locus individually using reversible
	jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The relative support of each model
	varies widely among loci, but the GSM is the only model that always
	receives at least 9\% support, whatever the locus. The analysis also
	provides robust estimates of mutation parameters for each locus and
	of the divergence time of the two invasive lineages (67,000 generations
	with a 90\% credibility interval of 35,000-174,000). With an average
	of 10 generations per year, this divergence time fits with the last
	post-glacial Korea-Japan land separation.},

  abstract = {The patterns of mutation and evolution at 13 microsatellite loci were
	studied in the filamentous fungal genus Neurospora. First, a detailed
	investigation was performed on five microsatellite loci by sequencing
	each microsatellite, together with its nonrepetitive flanking regions,
	from a set of 147 individuals from eight species of Neurospora. To
	elucidate the genealogical relationships among microsatellite alleles,
	repeat number was mapped onto trees constructed from flanking-sequence
	data. This approach allowed the potentially convergent microsatellite
	mutations to be placed in the evolutionary context of the less rapidly
	evolving flanking regions, revealing the complexities of the mutational
	processes that have generated the allelic diversity conventionally
	assessed in population genetic studies. In addition to changes in
	repeat number, frequent substitution mutations within the microsatellites
	were detected, as were substitutions and insertion/deletions within
	the flanking regions. By comparing microsatellite and flanking-sequence
	divergence, clear evidence of interspecific allele length homoplasy
	and microsatellite mutational saturation was observed, suggesting
	that these loci are not appropriate for inferring phylogenetic relationships
	among species. In contrast, little evidence of intraspecific mutational
	saturation was observed, confirming the utility of these loci for
	population-level analyses. Frequency distributions of alleles within
	species were generally consistent with the stepwise mutational model.
	By comparing variation within species at the microsatellites and
	the flanking-sequence, estimated microsatellite mutation rates were
	approximately 2500 times greater than mutation rates of flanking
	DNA and were consistent with estimates from yeast and fruit flies.
	A positive relationship between repeat number and variance in repeat
	number was significant across three genealogical depths, suggesting
	that longer microsatellite alleles are more mutable than shorter
	alleles. To test if the observed patterns of microsatellite variation
	and mutation could be generalized, an additional eight microsatellite
	loci were characterized and sequenced from a subset of the same Neurospora
	individuals.},

	C. elegans, consistent with the cumulative mutational effects on

	differs between repeat types and, in some cases, between species.
