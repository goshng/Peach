  abstract = {Recent developments in marginal likelihood estimation for model selection
	in the field of Bayesian phylogenetics and molecular evolution have
	emphasized the poor performance of the harmonic mean estimator (HME).
	Although these studies have shown the merits of new approaches applied
	to standard normally distributed examples and small real-world data
	sets, not much is currently known concerning the performance and
	computational issues of these methods when fitting complex evolutionary
	and population genetic models to empirical real-world data sets.
	Further, these approaches have not yet seen widespread application
	in the field due to the lack of implementations of these computationally
	demanding techniques in commonly used phylogenetic packages. We here
	investigate the performance of some of these new marginal likelihood
	estimators, specifically, path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone (SS)
	sampling for comparing models of demographic change and relaxed molecular
	clocks, using synthetic data and real-world examples for which unexpected
	inferences were made using the HME. Given the drastically increased
	computational demands of PS and SS sampling, we also investigate
	a posterior simulation-based analogue of Akaike's information criterion
	(AIC) through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a model comparison
	approach that shares with the HME the appealing feature of having
	a low computational overhead over the original MCMC analysis. We
	confirm that the HME systematically overestimates the marginal likelihood
	and fails to yield reliable model classification and show that the
	AICM performs better and may be a useful initial evaluation of model
	choice but that it is also, to a lesser degree, unreliable. We show
	that PS and SS sampling substantially outperform these estimators
	and adjust the conclusions made concerning previous analyses for
	the three real-world data sets that we reanalyzed. The methods used
	in this article are now available in BEAST, a powerful user-friendly
	software package to perform Bayesian evolutionary analyses.},

  abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular
	clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance
	in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically
	unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these
	two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed
	molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate
	to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new
	approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe
	how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in
	the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times.
	Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness
	of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and
	phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches
	in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are
	not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these
	datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular
	clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses
	of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate
	alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically
	more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while
	adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},

  abstract = {Relaxed molecular clock models allow divergence time dating and "relaxed
	phylogenetic" inference, in which a time tree is estimated in the
	face of unequal rates across lineages. We present a new method for
	relaxing the assumption of a strict molecular clock using Markov
	chain Monte Carlo to implement Bayesian modeling averaging over random
	local molecular clocks. The new method approaches the problem of
	rate variation among lineages by proposing a series of local molecular
	clocks, each extending over a subregion of the full phylogeny. Each
	branch in a phylogeny (subtending a clade) is a possible location
	for a change of rate from one local clock to a new one. Thus, including
	both the global molecular clock and the unconstrained model results,
	there are a total of 2(2n-2) possible rate models available for averaging
	with 1, 2, ..., 2n - 2 different rate categories.We propose an efficient
	method to sample this model space while simultaneously estimating
	the phylogeny. The new method conveniently allows a direct test of
	the strict molecular clock, in which one rate rules them all, against
	a large array of alternative local molecular clock models. We illustrate
	the method's utility on three example data sets involving mammal,
	primate and influenza evolution. Finally, we explore methods to visualize
	the complex posterior distribution that results from inference under
	such models.The examples suggest that large sequence datasets may
	only require a small number of local molecular clocks to reconcile
	their branch lengths with a time scale. All of the analyses described
	here are implemented in the open access software package BEAST 1.5.4

  abstract = {The use of fossil evidence to calibrate divergence time estimation
	has a long history. More recently, Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
	has become the dominant method of divergence time estimation, and
	fossil evidence has been reinterpreted as the specification of prior
	distributions on the divergence times of calibration nodes. These
	so-called "soft calibrations" have become widely used but the statistical
	properties of calibrated tree priors in a Bayesian setting hashave
	not been carefully investigated. Here, we clarify that calibration
	densities, such as those defined in BEAST 1.5, do not represent the
	marginal prior distribution of the calibration node. We illustrate
	this with a number of analytical results on small trees. We also
	describe an alternative construction for a calibrated Yule prior
	on trees that allows direct specification of the marginal prior distribution
	of the calibrated divergence time, with or without the restriction
	of monophyly. This method requires the computation of the Yule prior
	conditional on the height of the divergence being calibrated. Unfortunately,
	a practical solution for multiple calibrations remains elusive. Our
	results suggest that direct estimation of the prior induced by specifying
	multiple calibration densities should be a prerequisite of any divergence

	Codon-based models allow for independent rates of synonymous and

	increase in phylogenetic accuracy. Unfortunately, due to the high
	number of codon states, computational burden has largely thwarted

	a systematic reinvestigation of the basal pterygote split. Our results
	suggest that outgroup choice and limited taxon sampling have been
	major sources of systematic error, even for data sets with a large
	number of characters (e.g., in phylogenomic data sets). In particular,
	a data set of 113 taxa provides consistent support for the Palaeoptera
	hypothesis (the grouping of Odonata with Ephemeroptera), whereas
	results from data sets with fewer taxa give inconsistent results
	and are highly sensitive to minor changes in data and methods. We
	also focus on recent methods that exploit temporal information using
	fossil calibrations, combined with additional assumptions about the
	evolutionary process, and so reduce the influence of outgroup choice.
	These methods are shown to provide more consistent results, for example,
	supporting Palaeoptera, even for data sets that previously supported
