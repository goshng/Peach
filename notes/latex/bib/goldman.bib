  abstract = {Previously proposed methods for protein secondary structure prediction
	from multiple sequence alignments do not efficiently extract the
	evolutionary information that these alignments contain. The predictions
	of these methods are less accurate than they could be, because of
	their failure to consider explicitly the phylogenetic tree that relates
	aligned protein sequences. As an alternative, we present a hidden
	Markov model approach to secondary structure prediction that more
	fully uses the evolutionary information contained in protein sequence
	alignments. A representative example is presented, and three experiments
	are performed that illustrate how the appropriate representation
	of evolutionary relatedness can improve inferences. We explain why
	similar improvement can be expected in other secondary structure
	prediction methods and indeed any comparative sequence analysis method.},

  abstract = {When detecting positive selection in proteins, the prevalence of errors
	resulting from misalignment and the ability of alignment filters
	to mitigate such errors are not well understood, but filters are
	commonly applied to try to avoid false positive results. Focusing
	on the sitewise detection of positive selection across a wide range
	of divergence levels and indel rates, we performed simulation experiments
	to quantify the false positives and false negatives introduced by
	alignment error and the ability of alignment filters to improve performance.
	We found that some aligners led to many false positives, whereas
	others resulted in very few. False negatives were a problem for all
	aligners, increasing with sequence divergence. Of the aligners tested,
	PRANK's codon-based alignments consistently performed the best and
	ClustalW performed the worst. Of the filters tested, GUIDANCE performed
	the best and Gblocks performed the worst. Although some filters showed
	good ability to reduce the error rates from ClustalW and MAFFT alignments,
	none were found to substantially improve the performance of PRANK
	alignments under most conditions. Our results revealed distinct trends
	in error rates and power levels for aligners and filters within a
	biologically plausible parameter space. With the best aligner, a
	low false positive rate was maintained even with extremely divergent
	indel-prone sequences. Controls using the true alignment and an optimal
	filtering method suggested that performance improvements could be
	gained by improving aligners or filters to reduce the prevalence
	of false negatives, especially at higher divergence levels and indel
	rates.},
