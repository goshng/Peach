  abstract = {With the number of fully sequenced genomes increasing steadily, there
	is greater interest in performing large-scale phylogenomic analyses
	from large numbers of individual gene families. Maximum likelihood
	(ML) has been shown repeatedly to be one of the most accurate methods
	for phylogenetic construction. Recently, there have been a number
	of algorithmic improvements in maximum-likelihood-based tree search
	methods. However, it can still take a long time to analyse the evolutionary
	history of many gene families using a single computer. Distributed
	computing refers to a method of combining the computing power of
	multiple computers in order to perform some larger overall calculation.
	In this article, we present the first high-throughput implementation
	of a distributed phylogenetics platform, MultiPhyl, capable of using
	the idle computational resources of many heterogeneous non-dedicated
	machines to form a phylogenetics supercomputer. MultiPhyl allows
	a user to upload hundreds or thousands of amino acid or nucleotide
	alignments simultaneously and perform computationally intensive tasks
	such as model selection, tree searching and bootstrapping of each
	of the alignments using many desktop machines. The program implements
	a set of 88 amino acid models and 56 nucleotide maximum likelihood
	models and a variety of statistical methods for choosing between
	alternative models. A MultiPhyl webserver is available for public
	use at: http://www.cs.nuim.ie/distributed/multiphyl.php.},

  abstract = {Likelihood applications have become a central approach for molecular
	evolutionary analyses since the first computationally tractable treatment
	two decades ago. Although Felsenstein's original pruning algorithm
	makes likelihood calculations feasible, it is usually possible to
	take advantage of repetitive structure present in the data to arrive
	at even greater computational reductions. In particular, alignment
	columns with certain similarities have components of the likelihood
	calculation that are identical and need not be recomputed if columns
	are evaluated in an optimal order. We develop an algorithm for exploiting
	this speed improvement via an application of graph theory. The reductions
	provided by the method depend on both the tree and the data, but
	typical savings range between 15\%and 50\%. Real-data examples with
	time reductions of 80\%have been identified. The overhead costs associated
	with implementing the algorithm are minimal, and they are recovered
	in all but the smallest data sets. The modifications will provide
	faster likelihood algorithms, which will allow likelihood methods
	to be applied to larger sets of taxa and to include more thorough
	searches of the tree topology space.},

	that are good approximations to optimal maximum-likelihood estimates
	under several commonly used substitution models. Use of these approximate
	branch lengths (rather than fixed arbitrary values) as starting points
	significantly reduces the time required for iteration to a solution
	that maximizes the likelihood of a tree. These branch lengths are
	close enough to the optimal values that they can be used without
	further iteration to calculate approximate maximum-likelihood scores
	that are very close to the "exact" scores found by iteration. Several
	strategies are described for using these approximate scores to substantially
	reduce times needed for maximum-likelihood tree searches.},

  abstract = {We have developed a generalization of Kimura's Markov chain model
	for base substitution at a single nucleotide site. This generalized
	model incorporates more flexible transition rates and consequently
	allows irreversible as well as reversible chains. Because the model
	embodies just the right amount of symmetry, it permits explicit calculation
	of finite-time transition probabilities and equilibrium distributions.
	The model also meshes well with maximum likelihood methods for phylogenetic
	analysis. Quick calculation of likelihoods and their derivatives
	can be carried out by adapting Baum's forward and backward algorithms
	from the theory of hidden Markov chains. Analysis of HIV sequence
	data illustrates the speed of the algorithms on trees with many contemporary
	taxa. Analysis of some of Lake's data on the origin of the eukaryotic
	nucleus contrasts the reversible and irreversible versions of the
	model.},
