  abstract = {The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is the
	major sugar uptake system in oral streptococci. The role of EIIAB(Man)
	(encoded by manL) in gene regulation and sugar transport was investigated
	in Streptococcus mutans UA159. The manL knockout strain, JAM1, grew
	more slowly than the wild-type strain in glucose but grew faster
	in mannose and did not display diauxic growth, indicating that EIIAB(Man)
	is involved in sugar uptake and in carbohydrate catabolite repression.
	PTS assays of JAM1, and of strains lacking the inducible (fruI) and
	constitutive (fruCD) EII fructose, revealed that S. mutans EIIAB(Man)
	transported mannose and glucose and provided evidence that there
	was also a mannose-inducible or glucose-repressible mannose PTS.
	Additionally, there appears to be a fructose PTS that is different
	than FruI and FruCD. To determine whether EIIAB(Man) controlled expression
	of the known virulence genes, glucosyltransferases (gtfBC) and fructosyltransferase
	(ftf) promoter fusions of these genes were established in the wild-type
	and EIIAB(Man)-deficient strains. In the manL mutant, the level of
	chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity expressed from the gtfBC
	promoter was up to threefold lower than that seen with the wild-type
	strain at pH 6 and 7, indicating that EIIAB(Man) is required for
	optimal expression of gtfBC. No significant differences were observed
	between the mutant and the wild-type background in ftf regulation,
	with the exception that under glucose-limiting conditions at pH 7,
	the mutant exhibited a 2.1-fold increase in ftf expression. Two-dimensional
	gel analysis of batch-grown cells of the EIIAB(Man)-deficient strain
	indicated that the expression of at least 38 proteins was altered
	compared to that seen with the wild-type strain, revealing that EIIAB(Man)
	has a pleiotropic effect on gene expression.},

  abstract = {CcpA globally regulates transcription in response to carbohydrate
	availability in many gram-positive bacteria, but its role in Streptococcus
	mutans remains enigmatic. Using the fructan hydrolase (fruA) gene
	of S. mutans as a model, we demonstrated that CcpA plays a direct
	role in carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Subsequently, the expression
	of 170 genes was shown to be differently expressed (> or = 2-fold)
	in glucose-grown wild-type (UA159) and CcpA-deficient (TW1) strains
	(P < or = 0.001). However, there were differences in expression of
	only 96 genes between UA159 and TW1 when cells were cultivated with
	the poorly repressing substrate galactose. Interestingly, 90 genes
	were expressed differently in wild-type S. mutans when glucose- and
	galactose-grown cells were compared, but the expression of 515 genes
	was altered in the CcpA-deficient strain in a similar comparison.
	Overall, our results supported the hypothesis that CcpA has a major
	role in CCR and regulation of gene expression but revealed that in
	S. mutans there is a substantial CcpA-independent network that regulates
	gene expression in response to the carbohydrate source. Based on
	the genetic studies, biochemical and physiological experiments demonstrated
	that loss of CcpA impacts the ability of S. mutans to transport and
	grow on selected sugars. Also, the CcpA-deficient strain displayed
	an enhanced capacity to produce acid from intracellular stores of
	polysaccharides, could grow faster at pH 5.5, and could acidify the
	environment more rapidly and to a greater extent than the parental
	strain. Thus, CcpA directly modulates the pathogenic potential of
	S. mutans through global control of gene expression.},

  abstract = {We report here that HtrA plays a role in controlling growth and competence
	development for genetic transformation in Streptococcus mutans. Disruption
	of the gene for HtrA resulted in slow growth at 37 degrees C, reduced
	thermal tolerance at 42 degrees C, and altered sucrose-dependent
	biofilm formation on polystyrene surfaces. The htrA mutant also displayed
	a significantly reduced ability to undergo genetic transformation.
	A direct association between HtrA and genetic competence was demonstrated
	by the increased expression of the htrA gene upon exposure to competence-stimulating
	peptide. The induction of htrA gradually reached a maximum at around
	20 min, suggesting that HtrA may be involved in a late competence
	response. Complementation of the htrA mutation in a single copy on
	the chromosome of the mutant could rescue the defective growth phenotypes
	but not transformability, apparently because a second gene, spo0J,
	immediately downstream of htrA, also affects transformation. The
	htrA and spo0J genes were shown to be both individually transcribed
	and cotranscribed and probably have a functional connection in competence
	development. HtrA regulation appears to be finely tuned in S. mutans,
	since strains containing multiple copies of htrA exhibited abnormal
	growth phenotypes. Collectively, the results reveal HtrA to be an
	integral component of the regulatory network connecting cellular
	growth, stress tolerance, biofilm formation, and competence development
	and reveal a novel role for the spo0J gene in genetic transformation.},

  abstract = {The tight control of autolysis by Streptococcus mutans is critical
	for proper virulence gene expression and biofilm formation. A pair
	of dicistronic operons, SMU.575/574 (lrgAB) and SMU.1701/1700 (designated
	cidAB), encode putative membrane proteins that share structural features
	with the bacteriophage-encoded holin family of proteins, which modulate
	host cell lysis during lytic infection. Analysis of S. mutans lrg
	and cid mutants revealed a role for these operons in autolysis, biofilm
	formation, glucosyltransferase expression and oxidative stress tolerance.
	Expression of lrgAB was repressed during early exponential phase
	and was induced over 1000-fold as cells entered late exponential
	phase, whereas cidAB expression declined from early to late exponential
	phase. A two-component system encoded immediately upstream of lrgAB
	(LytST) was required for activation of lrgAB expression, but not
	for cid expression. In addition to availability of oxygen, glucose
	levels were revealed to affect lrg and cid transcription differentially
	and significantly, probably through CcpA (carbon catabolite protein
	A). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the Cid/Lrg system
	can affect several virulence traits of S. mutans, and its expression
	is controlled by two major environmental signals, oxygen and glucose.
	Moreover, cid/lrg expression is tightly regulated by LytST and CcpA.},

  abstract = {Oxygen profoundly affects the composition of oral biofilms. Recently,
	we showed that exposure of Streptococcus mutans to oxygen strongly
	inhibits biofilm formation and alters cell surface biogenesis. To
	begin to dissect the underlying mechanisms by which oxygen affects
	known virulence traits of S. mutans, transcription profiling was
	used to show that roughly 5\% of the genes of this organism are differentially
	expressed in response to aeration. Among the most profoundly upregulated
	genes were autolysis-related genes and those that encode bacteriocins,
	the ClpB protease chaperone subunit, pyruvate dehydrogenase, the
	tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, NADH oxidase enzymes, and certain
	carbohydrate transporters and catabolic pathways. Consistent with
	our observation that the ability of S. mutans to form biofilms was
	severely impaired by oxygen exposure, transcription of the gtfB gene,
	which encodes one of the primary enzymes involved in the production
	of water-insoluble, adhesive glucan exopolysaccharides, was down-regulated
	in cells growing aerobically. Further investigation revealed that
	transcription of gtfB, but not gtfC, was responsive to oxygen and
	that aeration causes major changes in the amount and degree of cell
	association of the Gtf enzymes. Moreover, inactivation of the VicK
	sensor kinase affected the expression and localization the GtfB and
	GtfC enzymes. This study provides novel insights into the complex
	transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory networks used
	by S. mutans to modulate virulence gene expression and exopolysaccharide
	production in response to changes in oxygen availability.},

	of the oral streptococci. The genome of S. mutans UA159, a serotype
	c strain, has been completely sequenced and is composed of 2,030,936
	base pairs. It contains 1,963 ORFs, 63\% of which have been assigned
	putative functions. The genome analysis provides further insight
	into how S. mutans has adapted to surviving the oral environment
	through resource acquisition, defense against host factors, and use
	of gene products that maintain its niche against microbial competitors.
	S. mutans metabolizes a wide variety of carbohydrates via nonoxidative
	pathways, and all of these pathways have been identified, along with
	the associated transport systems whose genes account for almost 15\%
	of the genome. Virulence genes associated with extracellular adherent
	glucan production, adhesins, acid tolerance, proteases, and putative
	hemolysins have been identified. Strain UA159 is naturally competent
	and contains all of the genes essential for competence and quorum
	sensing. Mobile genetic elements in the form of IS elements and transposons
	are prominent in the genome and include a previously uncharacterized
	conjugative transposon and a composite transposon containing genes
	for the synthesis of antibiotics of the gramicidin/bacitracin family;
	however, no bacteriophage genomes are present.},

  abstract = {The polymers of fructose, levan and inulin, as well as sucrose and
	raffinose, are substrates for the product of the fruA gene of Streptococcus
	mutans GS-5. The purpose of this study was to characterize the DNA
	immediately flanking fruA, to explore the regulation of expression
	of fruA by the carbohydrate source, and to begin to elucidate the
	molecular basis for differential expression of the gene. Located
	3' to fruA was an open reading frame (ORF) with similarity to beta-fructosidases
	which was cotranscribed with fruA. A transcriptional initiation site,
	located an appropriate distance from an extended -10-like promoter,
	was mapped at 165 bp 5' to the fruA structural gene. By the use of
	computer algorithms, two overlapping, stable stem-loop sequences
	with the potential to function as rho-independent terminators were
	found in the 5' untranslated region. Catabolite response elements
	(CREs), which have been shown to govern carbon catabolite repression
	(CCR) by functioning as negative cis elements in gram-positive bacteria,
	were located close to the promoter. The levels of production of fruA
	mRNA and FruA were elevated in cells growing on levan, inulin, or
	sucrose as the sole carbohydrate source, and repression was observed
	when cells were grown on readily metabolizable hexoses. Deletion
	derivatives containing fusions of fruA promoter regions, lacking
	sequences 5' or 3' to the promoter, and a promoterless chloramphenicol
	acetyltransferase gene were used (i) to demonstrate the functionality
	of the promoter mapped by primer extension, (ii) to demonstrate that
	CCR of the fru operon requires the CRE that is located 3' to the
	promoter region, and (iii) to provide preliminary evidence that supports
	the involvement of an antitermination mechanism in fruA induction.},

	organism's immediate, ongoing and genome-wide response to its environment.
	Microarray expression profiling provides a comprehensive portrait
	of the transcriptional world enabling us to view the organism as
	a 'system' that is more than the sum of its parts. The vigilance
	of microorganisms to environmental change, the alacrity of the transcriptional
	response, the short half-life of bacterial mRNA and the genome-scale
	nature of the investigation collectively explain the power of this
	method. These same features pose the most significant experimental
	design and execution issues which, unless surmounted, predictably
	generate a distorted image of the transcriptome. Conversely, the
	expression profile of a properly conceived and conducted microarray
	experiment can be used for hypothesis testing: disclosure of the
	metabolic and biosynthetic pathways that underlie adaptation of the
	organism to chang-ing conditions of growth; the identification of
	co-ordinately regulated genes; the regulatory circuits and signal
	transduction systems that mediate the adaptive response; and temporal
	features of developmental programmes. The study of bacterial pathogenesis
	by microarray expression profiling poses special challenges and opportunities.
	Although the technical hurdles are many, obtaining expression profiles
	of an organism growing in tissue will probably reveal strategies

	the beta-glucoside aesculin in the presence of glucose. When glucose
	was removed from the medium, the deletion strain regained the ability

  abstract = {Oral microbial-plaque communities are biofilms composed of numerous
	genetically distinct types of bacteria that live in close juxtaposition
	on host surfaces. These bacteria communicate through physical interactions
	called coaggregation and coadhesion, as well as other physiological
	and metabolic interactions. Streptococci and actinomyces are the
	major initial colonizers of the tooth surface, and the interactions
	between them and their substrata help establish the early biofilm
	community. Fusobacteria play a central role as physical bridges that
	mediate coaggregation of cells and as physiological bridges that
	promote anaerobic microenvironments which protect coaggregating strict
	anaerobes in an aerobic atmosphere. New technologies for investigating
	bacterial populations with 16S rDNA probes have uncovered previously
	uncultured bacteria and have offered an approach to in situ examination
	of the spatial arrangement of the participant cells in oral-plaque
	biofilms. Flow cells with saliva-coated surfaces are particularly
	useful for studies of biofilm formation and observation. The predicted
	sequential nature of colonization of the tooth surface by members
	of different genera can be investigated by using these new technologies
	and imaging the cells in situ with confocal scanning laser microscopy.
	Members of at least seven genera now can be subjected to genetic
	studies owing to the discovery of gene-transfer systems in these
	genera. Identification of contact-inducible genes in streptococci
	offers an avenue to explore bacterial responses to their environment
	and leads the way toward understanding communication among inhabitants
	of a multispecies biofilm.},

	only a subpopulation induces the expression of ComX in the presence

	shuts down ~3 to 4 h postinduction. Here, we combine for the first
	time, to our knowledge, the bacterial flow-cytometric sorting of
	cells and subpopulation-specific transcriptome analysis of both the
	competent and noncompetent fraction of CSP-treated S. mutans cells.
	Sorting was guided by a ComX-green fluorescent protein (ComX-GFP)
	reporter, and the transcriptome analysis demonstrated the successful
	combination of both methods, because a strong enrichment of transcripts
	for comX and its downstream genes was achieved. Three two-component
	systems were expressed in the competent fraction, and among them
	was ComDE. Moreover, the recently identified regulator system ComR/S
	was expressed exclusively in the competent fraction. In contrast,
	the expression of bacteriocin-related genes was at the same level
	in all cells. GFP reporter strains for ComE and CipB (mutacin V)
	confirmed this expression pattern on the single-cell level. Fluorescence
	microscopy revealed that some ComX-expressing cells committed autolysis
	in an early stage of competence initiation. In viable ComX-expressing
	cells, the uptake of DNA could be shown on the single-cell level.
	This study demonstrates that all cells in the population respond
	to CSP through the activation of bacteriocin-related genes. Some
	of these cells start to activate ComX expression but then segregate
	into two subpopulations, one becoming competent and another one that
	lyses, resulting in intrapopulation diversity.},

	it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur
	frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment
	is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.We implemented
	Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package
	that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT),
	to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference
	sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps.
	BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing
	machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations
	on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately
	10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition,
	BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map)

  abstract = {Dental plaque is a natural biofilm which has been a focus of attention
	for many years because of its known roles in caries and periodontal
	diseases. Acid production by plaque bacteria leads to the erosion
	of tooth mineral in caries, and the cariogenicity of plaque is related
	to population levels of acid-tolerant organisms such as mutans streptococci.
	However, the biofilm character of plaque allows for survival of a
	diverse flora, including less acid-tolerant organisms, some of which
	can produce ammonia from arginine or urea to counter acidification.
	Plaque is often considered to be relatively anaerobic. However, evidence
	is presented here that both supragingival and subgingival plaque
	have active oxygen metabolism and that plaque bacteria, including
	anaerobes, have developed defenses against oxidative stress. Even
	in subgingival plaque associated with periodontitis, measured residual
	oxygen levels are sufficient to allow for oxygen metabolism by organisms
	considered to be extremely anaerobic such as Treponema denticola,
	which metabolizes oxygen by means of NADH oxidases and produces the
	protective enzymes superoxide dismutase and NADH peroxidase. The
	finding that plaque bacteria produce a variety of protective enzymes
	is a good indicator that oxidative stress is a part of their everyday
	life. The biofilm character of plaque allows for population diversity

  abstract = {Digital gene expression (DGE) technologies measure gene expression
	by counting sequence tags. They are sensitive technologies for measuring
	gene expression on a genomic scale, without the need for prior knowledge
	of the genome sequence. As the cost of sequencing DNA decreases,
	the number of DGE datasets is expected to grow dramatically. Various
	tests of differential expression have been proposed for replicated
	DGE data using binomial, Poisson, negative binomial or pseudo-likelihood
	(PL) models for the counts, but none of the these are usable when
	the number of replicates is very small.We develop tests using the
	negative binomial distribution to model overdispersion relative to
	the Poisson, and use conditional weighted likelihood to moderate
	the level of overdispersion across genes. Not only is our strategy
	applicable even with the smallest number of libraries, but it also
	proves to be more powerful than previous strategies when more libraries
	are available. The methodology is equally applicable to other counting
	technologies, such as proteomic spectral counts.An R package can

	attention due to their ubiquitous nature and contribution to numerous
	cellular processes including survival, adaptation and pathogenesis.
	Existing computational approaches for identifying bacterial sRNAs
	demonstrate varying levels of success and there remains considerable
	room for improvement.Here we have proposed a transcriptional signal-based
	computational method to identify intergenic sRNA transcriptional
	units (TUs) in completely sequenced bacterial genomes. Our sRNAscanner
	tool uses position weight matrices derived from experimentally defined
	E. coli K-12 MG1655 sRNA promoter and rho-independent terminator
	signals to identify intergenic sRNA TUs through sliding window based
	genome scans. Analysis of genomes representative of twelve species
	suggested that sRNAscanner demonstrated equivalent sensitivity to
	sRNAPredict2, the best performing bioinformatics tool available presently.
	However, each algorithm yielded substantial numbers of known and
	uncharacterized hits that were unique to one or the other tool only.
	sRNAscanner identified 118 novel putative intergenic sRNA genes in
	Salmonella enterica Typhimurium LT2, none of which were flagged by
	sRNAPredict2. Candidate sRNA locations were compared with available
	deep sequencing libraries derived from Hfq-co-immunoprecipitated
	RNA purified from a second Typhimurium strain (Sittka et al. (2008)
	PLoS Genetics 4: e1000163). Sixteen potential novel sRNAs computationally
	predicted and detected in deep sequencing libraries were selected
	for experimental validation by Northern analysis using total RNA
	isolated from bacteria grown under eleven different growth conditions.
	RNA bands of expected sizes were detected in Northern blots for six
	of the examined candidates. Furthermore, the 5'-ends of these six
	Northern-supported sRNA candidates were successfully mapped using
	5'-RACE analysis.We have developed, computationally examined and
	experimentally validated the sRNAscanner algorithm. Data derived
	from this study has successfully identified six novel S. Typhimurium
	sRNA genes. In addition, the computational specificity analysis we
	have undertaken suggests that approximately 40\% of sRNAscanner hits
	with high cumulative sum of scores represent genuine, undiscovered
	sRNA genes. Collectively, these data strongly support the utility
	of sRNAscanner and offer a glimpse of its potential to reveal large
	numbers of sRNA genes that have to date defied identification. sRNAscanner

	of a z score, is normalized with respect to both sequence length

	encode polypeptides homologous to fructose-specific enzyme II (II(Fru))
	of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar:phosphotransferase system,

	agent of human dental caries. The fruC and fruD genes encoded domains
	BC and domain A of II(Fru), respectively. The fruI gene encoded IICBA(Fru).
	Northern hybridization and slot blot analysis showed that expression
	of fruI was inducible by sucrose and fructose, while fruCD were expressed
	constitutively and at much lower levels. Inactivation of either fruI
	or fruCD alone, or of both fruCD and fruI, had no major impact on
	growth on fructose at a concentration of 0.5\% (w/v). However, when
	the strains were grown with 0.2\% fructose as the sole carbohydrate
	source, a significant decrease in the growth rate was seen with the
	fruCD/fruI double mutants. Assays of sugar:phosphotransferase activity
	showed that the fruCD/fruI double mutants had roughly 30\% of the
	capacity of the wild-type strain to transport fructose via the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent
	sugar:phosphotransferase system. Xylitol toxicity assays indicated
	that the inducible fructose permease was responsible for xylitol

  abstract = {The ability of Streptococcus mutans to catabolize cellobiose, a beta-linked
	glucoside generated during the hydrolysis of cellulose, is shown
	to be regulated by a transcriptional regulator, CelR, which is encoded
	by an operon with a phospho-beta-glucosidase (CelA) and a cellobiose-specific
	sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) permease (EII(Cel)). The roles
	of CelR, EII(Cel) components, and certain fructose/mannose-PTS permeases
	in the transcriptional regulation of the cel locus were analyzed.
	The results revealed that (i) the celA and celB (EIIB(Cel)) gene
	promoters require CelR for transcriptional activation in response
	to cellobiose, but read-through from the celA promoter contributes
	to expression of the EII(Cel) genes; (ii) the EII(Cel) subunits were
	required for growth on cellobiose and for transcriptional activation
	of the cel genes; (iii) CcpA plays little direct role in catabolite
	repression of the cel regulon, but loss of specific PTS permeases
	alleviated repression of cel genes in the presence of preferred carbohydrates;
	and (iv) glucose could induce transcription of the cel regulon when
	transported by EII(Cel). CelR derivatives containing amino acid substitutions
	for five conserved histidine residues in two PTS regulatory domains
	and an EIIA-like domain also provided important insights regarding
	the function of this regulator. Based on these data, a model for
	the involvement of PTS permeases and the general PTS proteins enzyme
	I and HPr was developed that reveals a critical role for the PTS
	in CcpA-independent catabolite repression and induction of cel gene
	expression in S. mutans.},

	potent inducer of the levD and fruA operons; (iii) CcpA regulates
	levD expression in a carbohydrate-specific manner; (iv) deletion
	of the genes for the fructose/mannose-EII enzymes of S. mutans (manL,
	fruI and levD) enhances levD expression; (v) repression of the LevQRST
	regulon by EII enzymes depends on the presence of their substrates
	and requires LevR, but not LevQST; and (vi) CcpA inhibits expression
	of the manL and fruI genes to indirectly control the LevQRST regulon.
	Further, the manL, ccpA, fruI/fruCD and levD gene products differentially
	exert control over the cellobiose and lactose operons. Collectively,

	have an important role in oral microbial ecology and can contribute

	understand the metabolism of lactose and galactose by Streptococcus
	mutans, the major etiological agent of human tooth decay, a genetic
	analysis of the tagatose-6-phosphate (lac) and Leloir (gal) pathways
	was performed in strain UA159. Deletion of each gene in the lac operon
	caused various alterations in expression of a P(lacA)-cat promoter
	fusion and defects in growth on either lactose (lacA, lacB, lacF,
	lacE, and lacG), galactose (lacA, lacB, lacD, and lacG) or both sugars
	(lacA, lacB, and lacG). Failure to grow in the presence of galactose
	or lactose by certain lac mutants appeared to arise from the accumulation
	of intermediates of galactose metabolism, particularly galatose-6-phosphate.
	The glucose- and lactose-PTS permeases, EII(Man) and EII(Lac), respectively,
	were shown to be the only effective transporters of galactose in
	S. mutans. Furthermore, disruption of manL, encoding EIIAB(Man),
	led to increased resistance to glucose-mediated CCR when lactose
	was used to induce the lac operon, but resulted in reduced lac gene
	expression in cells growing on galactose. Collectively, the results
