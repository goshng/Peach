  abstract = {Currently available methods for model selection used in phylogenetic
	analysis are based on an initial fixed-tree topology. Once a model
	is picked based on this topology, a rigorous search of the tree space
	is run under that model to find the maximum-likelihood estimate of
	the tree (topology and branch lengths) and the maximum-likelihood
	estimates of the model parameters. In this paper, we propose two
	extensions to the decision-theoretic (DT) approach that relax the
	fixed-topology restriction. We also relax the fixed-topology restriction
	for the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the Akaike information
	criterion (AIC) methods. We compare the performance of the different
	methods (the relaxed, restricted, and the likelihood-ratio test [LRT])
	using simulated data. This comparison is done by evaluating the relative
	complexity of the models resulting from each method and by comparing
	the performance of the chosen models in estimating the true tree.
	We also compare the methods relative to one another by measuring
	the closeness of the estimated trees corresponding to the different
	chosen models under these methods. We show that varying the topology
	does not have a major impact on model choice. We also show that the
	outcome of the two proposed extensions is identical and is comparable
	to that of the BIC, Extended-BIC, and DT. Hence, using the simpler
	methods in choosing a model for analyzing the data is more computationally
	feasible, with results comparable to the more computationally intensive
	methods. Another outcome of this study is that earlier conclusions
	about the DT approach are reinforced. That is, LRT, Extended-AIC,
	and AIC result in more complicated models that do not contribute
	to the performance of the phylogenetic inference, yet cause a significant
	increase in the time required for data analysis.},

	problem of phylogenetic model selection. Here we use a simulation
	approach to assess the performance of this method and compare it
	to Akaike weights, a measure of model uncertainty that is based on
	the Akaike information criterion. Under conditions where the assumptions
	of the candidate models matched the generating conditions, both Bayesian
	and AIC-based methods perform well. The 95\% credible interval contained
	the generating model close to 95\% of the time. However, the size
	of the credible interval differed with the Bayesian credible set
	containing approximately 25\% to 50\% fewer models than an AIC-based
	credible interval. The posterior probability was a better indicator
	of the correct model than the Akaike weight when all assumptions
	were met but both measures performed similarly when some model assumptions
	were violated. Models in the Bayesian posterior distribution were
	also more similar to the generating model in their number of parameters
	and were less biased in their complexity. In contrast, Akaike-weighted
	models were more distant from the generating model and biased towards
	slightly greater complexity. The AIC-based credible interval appeared
	to be more robust to the violation of the rate homogeneity assumption.
	Both AIC and Bayesian approaches suggest that substantial uncertainty
	can accompany the choice of model for phylogenetic analyses, suggesting
	that alternative candidate models should be examined in analysis
	of phylogenetic data. [AIC; Akaike weights; Bayesian phylogenetics;

  abstract = {Variations of nucleotidic composition affect phylogenetic inference
	conducted under stationary models of evolution. In particular, they
	may cause unrelated taxa sharing similar base composition to be grouped
	together in the resulting phylogeny. To address this problem, we
	developed a nonstationary and nonhomogeneous model accounting for
	compositional biases. Unlike previous nonstationary models, which
	are branchwise, that is, assume that base composition only changes
	at the nodes of the tree, in our model, the process of compositional
	drift is totally uncoupled from the speciation events. In addition,
	the total number of events of compositional drift distributed across
	the tree is directly inferred from the data. We implemented the method
	in a Bayesian framework, relying on Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms,
	and applied it to several nucleotidic data sets. In most cases, the
	stationarity assumption was rejected in favor of our nonstationary
	model. In addition, we show that our method is able to resolve a
	well-known artifact. By Bayes factor evaluation, we compared our
	model with 2 previously developed nonstationary models. We show that
	the coupling between speciations and compositional shifts inherent
	to branchwise models may lead to an overparameterization, resulting
	in a lesser fit. In some cases, this leads to incorrect conclusions,
	concerning the nature of the compositional biases. In contrast, our
	compound model more flexibly adapts its effective number of parameters
	to the data sets under investigation. Altogether, our results show
	that accounting for nonstationary sequence evolution may require
	more elaborate and more flexible models than those currently used.},

	Nevertheless, computation time burden limits the application of methods
	such as maximum likelihood nonparametric bootstrap to assess reliability

	inference of phylogeny, which expresses branch support as posterior
	probabilities, has been introduced. However, marked discrepancies
	exist between nonparametric bootstrap proportions and Bayesian posterior
	probabilities, leading to difficulties in the interpretation of sometimes
	strongly conflicting results. As an attempt to reconcile these two
	indices of node reliability, we apply the nonparametric bootstrap
	resampling procedure to the Bayesian approach. The correlation between
	posterior probabilities, bootstrap maximum likelihood percentages,
	and bootstrapped posterior probabilities was studied for eight highly
	diverse empirical data sets and were also investigated using experimental
	simulation. Our results show that the relation between posterior
	probabilities and bootstrapped maximum likelihood percentages is
	highly variable but that very strong correlations always exist when
	Bayesian node support is estimated on bootstrapped character matrices.
	Moreover, simulations corroborate empirical observations in suggesting
	that, being more conservative, the bootstrap approach might be less
	prone to strongly supporting a false phylogenetic hypothesis. Thus,
	apparent conflicts in topology recovered by the Bayesian approach
	were reduced after bootstrapping. Both posterior probabilities and
	bootstrap supports are of great interest to phylogeny as potential
	upper and lower bounds of node reliability, but they are surely not

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Maximum likelihood (ML) methods have become very popular
	for constructing phylogenetic trees from sequence data. However,
	despite noticeable recent progress, with large and difficult datasets
	(e.g. multiple genes with conflicting signals) current ML programs
	still require huge computing time and can become trapped in bad local
	optima of the likelihood function. When this occurs, the resulting
	trees may still show some of the defects (e.g. long branch attraction)
	of starting trees obtained using fast distance or parsimony programs.
	METHODS: Subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) topological rearrangements
	are usually sufficient to intensively search the tree space. Here,
	we propose two new methods to make SPR moves more efficient. The
	first method uses a fast distance-based approach to detect the least
	promising candidate SPR moves, which are then simply discarded. The
	second method locally estimates the change in likelihood for any
	remaining potential SPRs, as opposed to globally evaluating the entire
	tree for each possible move. These two methods are implemented in
	a new algorithm with a sophisticated filtering strategy, which efficiently
	selects potential SPRs and concentrates most of the likelihood computation
	on the promising moves. RESULTS: Experiments with real datasets comprising
	35-250 taxa show that, while indeed greatly reducing the amount of
	computation, our approach provides likelihood values at least as
	good as those of the best-known ML methods so far and is very robust
	to poor starting trees. Furthermore, combining our new SPR algorithm
	with local moves such as PHYML's nearest neighbor interchanges, the
	time needed to find good solutions can sometimes be reduced even
	more.},

	factors. Current implementations of any of these criteria suffer
	from the limitation that only a small set of models are examined,

	In this article, we expand the pool of candidate substitution models
	to include all possible time-reversible models. This set includes
	seven models that have already been described. We show how Bayes
	factors can be calculated for these models using reversible jump
	Markov chain Monte Carlo, and apply the method to 16 DNA sequence
	alignments. For each data set, we compare the model with the best
	Bayes factor to the best models chosen using AIC and BIC. We find

	amino acid substitution bias. Amino acid models have been empirical,
	attempting to summarize the replacement patterns observed in large
	quantities of data and not explicitly considering the distinct factors
	that shape protein evolution. We have estimated the first empirical
	codon model (ECM). Previous codon models assume that protein evolution
	proceeds only by successive single nucleotide substitutions, but
	our results indicate that model accuracy is significantly improved
	by incorporating instantaneous doublet and triplet changes. We also
	find that the affiliations between codons, the amino acid each encodes
	and the physicochemical properties of the amino acids are main factors
	driving the process of codon evolution. Neither multiple nucleotide
	changes nor the strong influence of the genetic code nor amino acids'
	physicochemical properties form a part of standard mechanistic models
	and their views of how codon evolution proceeds. We have implemented
	the ECM for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis, and an assessment
	of its ability to describe protein evolution shows that it consistently
	outperforms comparable mechanistic codon models. We point out the
	biological interpretation of our ECM and possible consequences for
	studies of selection.},

	process of branch swapping with equally weighted characters, followed
	by swapping with reweighted characters. This process increases the
	efficiency of the search because, after each round of swapping with
	reweighted characters, the subsequent swapping with equal weights
	will start from a different group (island) of trees that are only
	slightly, if at all, less optimal. In contrast, conventional heuristic
	searching with constant equal weighting can become trapped on islands
	of suboptimal trees. We test the new strategy against a conventional
	strategy and a modified conventional strategy and show that, within
	a given time, the new strategy finds trees that are markedly more
	parsimonious. We also compare our new strategy with a recent, independently
	developed strategy known as the Parsimony Ratchet.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive phylogenetic trees are essential tools to better understand
	evolutionary processes. For many groups of organisms or projects
	aiming to build the Tree of Life, comprehensive phylogenetic analysis
	implies sampling hundreds to thousands of taxa. For the tree of all
	life this task rises to a highly conservative 13 million. Here, we
	assessed the performances of methods to reconstruct large trees using
	Monte Carlo simulations with parameters inferred from four large
	angiosperm DNA matrices, containing between 141 and 567 taxa. For
	each data set, parameters of the HKY85+G model were estimated and
	used to simulate 20 new matrices for sequence lengths from 100 to
	10,000 base pairs. Maximum parsimony and neighbor joining were used
	to analyze each simulated matrix. In our simulations, accuracy was
	measured by counting the number of nodes in the model tree that were
	correctly inferred. The accuracy of the two methods increased very
	quickly with the addition of characters before reaching a plateau
	around 1000 nucleotides for any sizes of trees simulated. An increase
	in the number of taxa from 141 to 567 did not significantly decrease
	the accuracy of the methods used, despite the increase in the complexity
	of tree space. Moreover, the distribution of branch lengths rather
	than the rate of evolution was found to be the most important factor
	for accurately inferring these large trees. Finally, a tree containing
	13,000 taxa was created to represent a hypothetical tree of all angiosperm
	genera and the efficiency of phylogenetic reconstructions was tested
	with simulated matrices containing an increasing number of nucleotides
	up to a maximum of 30,000. Even with such a large tree, our simulations
	suggested that simple heuristic searches were able to infer up to
	80\% of the nodes correctly.},

	large phylogenies with maximum likelihood (ML). Low-level technical
	optimizations, a modification of the search algorithm, and the use
	of the GTR+CAT approximation as replacement for GTR+Gamma yield a
	program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the previous
	version of RAxML. A large-scale performance comparison with GARLI,
	PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real data containing 1000 up to 6722
	taxa shows that RAxML requires at least 5.6 times less main memory
	and yields better trees in similar times than the best competing
	program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets > or =4000
	taxa it also runs 2-3 times faster than GARLI. RAxML has been parallelized
	with MPI to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and inferences on
	distinct starting trees. The program has been used to compute ML
	trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25,057

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The computation of large phylogenetic trees with statistical
	models such as maximum likelihood or bayesian inference is computationally
	extremely intensive. It has repeatedly been demonstrated that these
	models are able to recover the true tree or a tree which is topologically
	closer to the true tree more frequently than less elaborate methods
	such as parsimony or neighbor joining. Due to the combinatorial and
	computational complexity the size of trees which can be computed
	on a Biologist's PC workstation within reasonable time is limited
	to trees containing approximately 100 taxa. RESULTS: In this paper
	we present the latest release of our program RAxML-III for rapid
	maximum likelihood-based inference of large evolutionary trees which
	allows for computation of 1.000-taxon trees in less than 24 hours
	on a single PC processor. We compare RAxML-III to the currently fastest
	implementations for maximum likelihood and bayesian inference: PHYML
	and MrBayes. Whereas RAxML-III performs worse than PHYML and MrBayes
	on synthetic data it clearly outperforms both programs on all real
	data alignments used in terms of speed and final likelihood values.

  abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) plays a critical role in evolution
	across all domains of life with important biological and medical
	implications. I propose a simple class of stochastic models to examine
	HGT using multiple orthologous gene alignments. The models function
	in a hierarchical phylogenetic framework. The top level of the hierarchy
	is based on a random walk process in "tree space" that allows for
	the development of a joint probabilistic distribution over multiple
	gene trees and an unknown, but estimable species tree. I consider
	two general forms of random walks. The first form is derived from
	the subtree prune and regraft (SPR) operator that mirrors the observed
	effects that HGT has on inferred trees. The second form is based
	on walks over complete graphs and offers numerically tractable solutions
	for an increasing number of taxa. The bottom level of the hierarchy
	utilizes standard phylogenetic models to reconstruct gene trees given
	multiple gene alignments conditional on the random walk process.
	I develop a well-mixing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to fit
	the models in a Bayesian framework. I demonstrate the flexibility
	of these stochastic models to test competing ideas about HGT by examining
	the complexity hypothesis. Using 144 orthologous gene alignments
	from six prokaryotes previously collected and analyzed, Bayesian
	model selection finds support for (1) the SPR model over the alternative
	form, (2) the 16S rRNA reconstruction as the most likely species
	tree, and (3) increased HGT of operational genes compared to informational
	genes.},

  abstract = {Almost all studies that estimate phylogenies from DNA sequence data
	under the maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion employ an approximate
	approach. Most commonly, model parameters are estimated on some initial
	phylogenetic estimate derived using a rapid method (neighbor-joining
	or parsimony). Parameters are then held constant during a tree search,
	and ideally, the procedure is repeated until convergence is achieved.
	However, the effectiveness of this approximation has not been formally
	assessed, in part because doing so requires computationally intensive,
	full-optimization analyses. Here, we report both indirect and direct
	evaluations of the effectiveness of successive approximations. We
	obtained an indirect evaluation by comparing the results of replicate
	runs on real data that use random trees to provide initial parameter
	estimates. For six real data sets taken from the literature, all
	replicate iterative searches converged to the same joint estimates
	of topology and model parameters, suggesting that the approximation
	is not starting-point dependent, as long as the heuristic searches
	of tree space are rigorous. We conducted a more direct assessment
	using simulations in which we compared the accuracy of phylogenies
	estimated using full optimization of all model parameters on each
	tree evaluated to the accuracy of trees estimated via successive
	approximations. There is no significant difference between the accuracy
	of the approximation searches relative to full-optimization searches.
	Our results demonstrate that successive approximation is reliable
	and provide reassurance that this much faster approach is safe to
	use for ML estimation of topology.},
