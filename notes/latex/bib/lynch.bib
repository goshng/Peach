  abstract = {Improvements in sequencing technology over the past 5 years are leading
	to routine application of shotgun sequencing in the fields of ecology
	and evolution. However, the theory to estimate evolutionary parameters
	from these data is still being worked out. Here we present an extension
	and implementation of part of this theory, mlRho. This program can
	efficiently compute the following three maximum likelihood estimators
	based on shotgun sequence data obtained from single diploid individuals:
	the population mutation rate (4N(e)mu), the sequencing error rate,
	and the population recombination rate (4N(e)c). We demonstrate the
	accuracy of mlRho by applying it to simulated data sets. In addition,
	we analyse the genomes of the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis and the
	water flea Daphnia pulex. Ciona intestinalis is an obligate outcrosser,
	while D. pulex is a cyclic parthenogen, and we discuss how these
	contrasting life histories are reflected in our parameter estimates.
	The program mlRho is freely available from http://guanine.evolbio.mpg.de/mlRho.},

  abstract = {Next-generation sequencing technology provides novel opportunities
	for gathering genome-scale sequence data in natural populations,
	laying the empirical foundation for the evolving field of population
	genomics. Here we conducted a genome scan of nucleotide diversity
	and differentiation in natural populations of threespine stickleback
	(Gasterosteus aculeatus). We used Illumina-sequenced RAD tags to
	identify and type over 45,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
	in each of 100 individuals from two oceanic and three freshwater
	populations. Overall estimates of genetic diversity and differentiation
	among populations confirm the biogeographic hypothesis that large
	panmictic oceanic populations have repeatedly given rise to phenotypically
	divergent freshwater populations. Genomic regions exhibiting signatures
	of both balancing and divergent selection were remarkably consistent
	across multiple, independently derived populations, indicating that
	replicate parallel phenotypic evolution in stickleback may be occurring
	through extensive, parallel genetic evolution at a genome-wide scale.
	Some of these genomic regions co-localize with previously identified
	QTL for stickleback phenotypic variation identified using laboratory
	mapping crosses. In addition, we have identified several novel regions
	showing parallel differentiation across independent populations.
	Annotation of these regions revealed numerous genes that are candidates
	for stickleback phenotypic evolution and will form the basis of future
	genetic analyses in this and other organisms. This study represents
	the first high-density SNP-based genome scan of genetic diversity
	and differentiation for populations of threespine stickleback in
	the wild. These data illustrate the complementary nature of laboratory
	crosses and population genomic scans by confirming the adaptive significance
	of previously identified genomic regions, elucidating the particular
	evolutionary and demographic history of such regions in natural populations,
	and identifying new genomic regions and candidate genes of evolutionary
	significance.},

  abstract = {It is known that sequencing error can bias estimation of evolutionary
	or population genetic parameters. This problem is more prominent
	in deep resequencing studies because of their large sample size n,
	and a higher probability of error at each nucleotide site. We propose
	a new method based on the composite likelihood of the observed SNP
	configurations to infer population mutation rate theta = 4N(e)micro,
	population exponential growth rate R, and error rate epsilon, simultaneously.
	Using simulation, we show the combined effects of the parameters,
	theta, n, epsilon, and R on the accuracy of parameter estimation.
	We compared our maximum composite likelihood estimator (MCLE) of
	theta with other theta estimators that take into account the error.
	The results show the MCLE performs well when the sample size is large
	or the error rate is high. Using parametric bootstrap, composite
	likelihood can also be used as a statistic for testing the model
	goodness-of-fit of the observed DNA sequences. The MCLE method is
	applied to sequence data on the ANGPTL4 gene in 1832 African American
	and 1045 European American individuals.},

  abstract = {A new generation of high-throughput sequencing strategies will soon
	lead to the acquisition of high-coverage genomic profiles of hundreds
	to thousands of individuals within species, generating unprecedented
	levels of information on the frequencies of nucleotides segregating
	at individual sites. However, because these new technologies are
	error prone and yield uneven coverage of alleles in diploid individuals,
	they also introduce the need for novel methods for analyzing the
	raw read data. A maximum-likelihood method for the estimation of
	allele frequencies is developed, eliminating both the need to arbitrarily
	discard individuals with low coverage and the requirement for an
	extrinsic measure of the sequence error rate. The resultant estimates
	are nearly unbiased with asymptotically minimal sampling variance,
	thereby defining the limits to our ability to estimate population-genetic
	parameters and providing a logical basis for the optimal design of
	population-genomic surveys.},

	need to account for the binomial sampling of parental alleles at
	individual nucleotide sites and to eliminate bias from various sources
	of sequence errors. To minimize the effects of both problems, methods
	are developed for generating nearly unbiased and minimum-sampling-variance
	estimates of a number of key parameters, including the average nucleotide
	heterozygosity and its variance among sites, the pattern of decomposition
	of linkage disequilibrium with physical distance, and the rate and
	molecular spectrum of spontaneously arising mutations. These methods
