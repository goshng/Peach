  abstract = {Large population sizes and global distributions generally associate
	with high mitochondrial DNA control region (CR) diversity. The sperm
	whale (Physeter macrocephalus) is an exception, showing low CR diversity
	relative to other cetaceans; however, diversity levels throughout
	the remainder of the sperm whale mitogenome are unknown. We sequenced
	20 mitogenomes from 17 sperm whales representative of worldwide diversity
	using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies (Illumina GAIIx,
	Roche 454 GS Junior). Resequencing of three individuals with both
	NGS platforms and partial Sanger sequencing showed low discrepancy
	rates (454-Illumina: 0.0071\%; Sanger-Illumina: 0.0034\%; and Sanger-454:
	0.0023\%) confirming suitability of both NGS platforms for investigating
	low mitogenomic diversity. Using the 17 sperm whale mitogenomes in
	a phylogenetic reconstruction with 41 other species, including 11
	new dolphin mitogenomes, we tested two hypotheses for the low CR
	diversity. First, the hypothesis that CR-specific constraints have
	reduced diversity solely in the CR was rejected as diversity was
	low throughout the mitogenome, not just in the CR (overall diversity
	? = 0.096\%; protein-coding 3rd codon = 0.22\%; CR = 0.35\%), and
	CR phylogenetic signal was congruent with protein-coding regions.
	Second, the hypothesis that slow substitution rates reduced diversity
	throughout the sperm whale mitogenome was rejected as sperm whales
	had significantly higher rates of CR evolution and no evidence of
	slow coding region evolution relative to other cetaceans. The estimated
	time to most recent common ancestor for sperm whale mitogenomes was
	72,800 to 137,400 years ago (95\% highest probability density interval),
	consistent with previous hypotheses of a bottleneck or selective
	sweep as likely causes of low mitogenome diversity.},

  abstract = {Pygmy populations are among the few hunter-gatherers currently living
	in sub-Saharan Africa and are mainly represented by two groups, Eastern
	and Western, according to their current geographical distribution.
	They are scattered across the Central African belt and surrounded
	by Bantu-speaking farmers, with whom they have complex social and
	economic interactions. To investigate the demographic history of
	Pygmy groups, a population approach was applied to the analysis of
	205 complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from ten central
	African populations. No sharing of maternal lineages was observed
	between the two Pygmy groups, with haplogroup L1c being characteristic
	of the Western group but most of Eastern Pygmy lineages falling into
	subclades of L0a, L2a, and L5. Demographic inferences based on Bayesian
	coalescent simulations point to an early split among the maternal
	ancestors of Pygmies and those of Bantu-speaking farmers (? 70,000
	years ago [ya]). Evidence for population growth in the ancestors
	of Bantu-speaking farmers has been observed, starting ? 65,000 ya,
	well before the diffusion of Bantu languages. Subsequently, the effective
	population size of the ancestors of Pygmies remained constant over
	time and ? 27,000 ya, coincident with the Last Glacial Maximum, Eastern
	and Western Pygmies diverged, with evidence of subsequent migration
	only among the Western group and the Bantu-speaking farmers. Western
	Pygmies show signs of a recent bottleneck 4,000-650 ya, coincident
	with the diffusion of Bantu languages, whereas Eastern Pygmies seem
	to have experienced a more ancient decrease in population size (20,000-4,000
	ya). In conclusion, the results of this first attempt at analyzing
	complete mtDNA sequences at the population level in sub-Saharan Africa
	not only support previous findings but also offer new insights into
	the demographic history of Pygmy populations, shedding new light
	on the ancient peopling of the African continent.},

  abstract = {The availability of mitochondrial genome sequences is growing as a
	result of recent technological advances in molecular biology. In
	phylogenetic analyses, the complete mitogenome is increasingly becoming
	the marker of choice, usually providing better phylogenetic resolution
	and precision relative to traditional markers such as cytochrome
	b (CYTB) and the control region (CR). In some cases, the differences
	in phylogenetic estimates between mitogenomic and single-gene markers
	have yielded incongruent conclusions. By comparing phylogenetic estimates
	made from different genes, we identified the most informative mitochondrial
	regions and evaluated the minimum amount of data necessary to reproduce
	the same results as the mitogenome. We compared results among individual
	genes and the mitogenome for recently published complete mitogenome
	datasets of selected delphinids (Delphinidae) and killer whales (genus
	Orcinus). Using Bayesian phylogenetic methods, we investigated differences
	in estimation of topologies, divergence dates, and clock-like behavior
	among genes for both datasets. Although the most informative regions
	were not the same for each taxonomic group (COX1, CYTB, ND3 and ATP6
	for Orcinus, and ND1, COX1 and ND4 for Delphinidae), in both cases
	they were equivalent to less than a quarter of the complete mitogenome.
	This suggests that gene information content can vary among groups,
	but can be adequately represented by a portion of the complete sequence.
	Although our results indicate that complete mitogenomes provide the
	highest phylogenetic resolution and most precise date estimates,
	a minimum amount of data can be selected using our approach when
	the complete sequence is unavailable. Studies based on single genes
	can benefit from the addition of a few more mitochondrial markers,
	producing topologies and date estimates similar to those obtained
	using the entire mitogenome.},

	Population genetic studies based on D-Loop sequences have shown considerable

	We found variation in the length of the ATP8 gene and a highly variable
	site in ND4 near a proton translocation channel in the resulting
	protein. Complete mitogenomes show strong support and resolution
	for phylogenetic relationships among all sea turtles, and reveal
	phylogeographic patterns within globally-distributed species. Although
	there was clear concordance between phylogenies and geographic origin

  abstract = {Global temperature increased by approximately half a degree (Celsius)
	within the last 150 years. Even this moderate warming had major impacts
	on Earth's ecological and biological systems, especially in the Arctic
	where the magnitude of abiotic changes even exceeds those in temperate
	and tropical biomes. Therefore, understanding the biological consequences
	of climate change on high latitudes is of critical importance for
	future conservation of the species living in this habitat. The past
	25,000 years can be used as a model for such changes, as they were
	marked by prominent climatic changes that influenced geographical
	distribution, demographic history and pattern of genetic variation
	of many extant species. We sequenced ancient and modern DNA of the
	collared lemming (Dicrostonyx torquatus), which is a key species
	of the arctic biota, from a single site (Pymva Shor, Northern Pre
	Urals, Russia) to see if climate warming events after the Last Glacial
	Maximum had detectable effects on the genetic variation of this arctic
	rodent species, which is strongly associated with a cold and dry
	climate.Using three dimensional network reconstructions we found
	a dramatic decline in genetic diversity following the LGM. Model-based
	approaches such as Approximate Bayesian Computation and Markov Chain
	Monte Carlo based Bayesian inference show that there is evidence
	for a population decline in the collared lemming following the LGM,
	with the population size dropping to a minimum during the Greenland
	Interstadial 1 (B?lling/Aller?d) warming phase at 14.5 kyrs BP.Our
	results show that previous climate warming events had a strong influence
	on genetic diversity and population size of collared lemmings. Due
	to its already severely compromised genetic diversity a similar population
	reduction as a result of the predicted future climate change could
	completely abolish the remaining genetic diversity in this population.
	Local population extinctions of collared lemmings would have severe
	effects on the arctic ecosystem, as collared lemmings are a key species

	Temporal genetic data present opportunities to reveal more complex

	Our analyses show that phylochronologic data can reveal more about
	population history than modern data alone, thus revealing 'cryptic'
	population processes, and enable us to determine whether simple or

	need for novel methods that consider gene flow, multiple populations

	Dichroplus elongatus which is an agricultural pest of crops and forage
	grasses of great economic significance in Argentina. We use Direct
	Amplification of Minisatellite Regions (DAMD) and partial sequences
	of the cytochrome oxydase 1 (COI) mitochondrial gene to investigate
	intraspecific structure, demographic history and gene flow patterns
	in twenty Argentinean populations of this species belonging to different
	geographic and biogeographic regions. DAMD data suggest that, although
	genetic drift and migration occur within and between populations,
	measurable relatedness among neighbouring populations declines with
	distance and dispersal over distances greater than 200 km is not
	typical, whereas effective gene flow may occur for populations separated
	by less than 100 km. Landscape analysis was useful to detect genetic
	discontinuities associated with environmental heterogeneity reflecting
	the changing agroecosystem. The COI results indicate the existence
	of strong genetic differentiation between two groups of populations
	located at both margins of the Paran? River which became separated
	during climate oscillations of the Middle Pleistocene, suggesting
	a significant restriction in effective dispersion mediated by females
	and large scale geographic differentiation. The number of migrants
	between populations estimated through mitochondrial and DAMD markers
	suggest that gene flow is low prompting a non-homogeneous spatial
	structure and justifying the variation through space. Moreover, the
	genetic analysis of both markers allows us to conclude that males
	appear to disperse more than females, reducing the chance of the
	genetic loss associated with recent anthropogenic fragmentation of

	structure among regional rookeries. We screened the majority of the
	mitochondrial genomes of 20 green turtles carrying the common haplotype
	CM-A5 and representing the rookeries of Buck Island, St. Croix, United
	States Virgin Islands (USVI); Aves Island, Venezuela; Galibi, Suriname;
	and Tortuguero, Costa Rica. Five single-nucleotide polymorphisms
	(SNPs) were identified that subdivided CM-A5 among regions. Mitogenomic
	pairwise ?(ST) values of eastern Caribbean rookery comparisons were
	markedly lower than the respective pairwise F(ST) values. This discrepancy
	results from the presence of haplotypes representing two divergent
	lineages in each rookery, highlighting the importance of choosing
	the appropriate test statistic for addressing the study question.
	Haplotype frequency differentiation supports demographic independence
	of Aves Island and Suriname, emphasizing the need to recognize the
	smaller Aves rookery as a distinct management unit. Aves Island and
	Buck Island rookeries shared mitogenomic haplotypes; however, frequency
	divergence suggests that the Buck Island rookery is sufficiently
	demographically isolated to warrant management unit status for the
	USVI rookeries. Given that haplotype sharing among rookeries is common
	in marine turtles with cosmopolitan distributions, mitogenomic sequencing
	may enhance inferences of population structure and phylogeography,
	as well as improve the resolution of mixed stock analyses aimed at
	estimating natal origins of foraging turtles.},

  abstract = {We previously developed a cladistic approach to identify subsets of
	haplotypes defined by restriction endonuclease mapping or DNA sequencing
	that are associated with significant phenotypic deviations. Our approach
	was limited to segments of DNA in which little recombination occurs.
	In such cases, a cladogram can be constructed from the restriction
	site or sequence data that represents the evolutionary steps that
	interrelate the observed haplotypes. The cladogram is used to define
	a nested statistical design to identify mutational steps associated
	with significant phenotypic deviations. The central assumption behind
	this strategy is that any undetected mutation causing a phenotypic
	effect is embedded within the same evolutionary history that is represented
	by the cladogram. The power of this approach depends upon the confidence
	one has in the particular cladogram used to draw inferences. In this
	paper, we present a strategy for estimating the set of cladograms
	that are consistent with a particular sample of either restriction
	site or nucleotide sequence data and that includes the possibility
	of recombination. We first evaluate the limits of parsimony in constructing
	cladograms. Once these limits have been determined, we construct
	the set of parsimonious and nonparsimonious cladograms that is consistent
	with these limits. Our estimation procedure also identifies haplotypes
	that are candidates for being products of recombination. If recombination
	is extensive, our algorithm subdivides the DNA region into two or
	more subsections, each having little or no internal recombination.
	We apply this estimation procedure to three data sets to illustrate
	varying degrees of cladogram ambiguity and recombination.},
