  abstract = {Global temperature increased by approximately half a degree (Celsius)
	within the last 150 years. Even this moderate warming had major impacts
	on Earth's ecological and biological systems, especially in the Arctic
	where the magnitude of abiotic changes even exceeds those in temperate
	and tropical biomes. Therefore, understanding the biological consequences
	of climate change on high latitudes is of critical importance for
	future conservation of the species living in this habitat. The past
	25,000 years can be used as a model for such changes, as they were
	marked by prominent climatic changes that influenced geographical
	distribution, demographic history and pattern of genetic variation
	of many extant species. We sequenced ancient and modern DNA of the
	collared lemming (Dicrostonyx torquatus), which is a key species
	of the arctic biota, from a single site (Pymva Shor, Northern Pre
	Urals, Russia) to see if climate warming events after the Last Glacial
	Maximum had detectable effects on the genetic variation of this arctic
	rodent species, which is strongly associated with a cold and dry
	climate.Using three dimensional network reconstructions we found
	a dramatic decline in genetic diversity following the LGM. Model-based
	approaches such as Approximate Bayesian Computation and Markov Chain
	Monte Carlo based Bayesian inference show that there is evidence
	for a population decline in the collared lemming following the LGM,
	with the population size dropping to a minimum during the Greenland
	Interstadial 1 (B¿lling/Aller¿d) warming phase at 14.5 kyrs BP.Our
	results show that previous climate warming events had a strong influence
	on genetic diversity and population size of collared lemmings. Due
	to its already severely compromised genetic diversity a similar population
	reduction as a result of the predicted future climate change could
	completely abolish the remaining genetic diversity in this population.
	Local population extinctions of collared lemmings would have severe
	effects on the arctic ecosystem, as collared lemmings are a key species
	in the trophic interactions and ecosystem processes in the Arctic.},
