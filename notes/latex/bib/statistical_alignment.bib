  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The evolutionary analysis of molecular sequence variation
	is a statistical enterprise. This is reflected in the increased use
	of probabilistic models for phylogenetic inference, multiple sequence

	a fast, flexible software architecture for Bayesian analysis of molecular
	sequences related by an evolutionary tree. A large number of popular
	stochastic models of sequence evolution are provided and tree-based
	models suitable for both within- and between-species sequence data

	of Java source code, 779 classes and 81 packages. It provides models
	for DNA and protein sequence evolution, highly parametric coalescent
	analysis, relaxed clock phylogenetics, non-contemporaneous sequence
	data, statistical alignment and a wide range of options for prior
	distributions. BEAST source code is object-oriented, modular in design
	and freely available at http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com/ under the

  title = {Investigating selection on viruses: a statistical alignment approach.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {304},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two problems complicate the study of selection in viral
	genomes: Firstly, the presence of genes in overlapping reading frames
	implies that selection in one reading frame can bias our estimates
	of neutral mutation rates in another reading frame. Secondly, the
	high mutation rates we are likely to encounter complicate the inference
	of a reliable alignment of genomes. To address these issues, we develop
	a model that explicitly models selection in overlapping reading frames.
	We then integrate this model into a statistical alignment framework,
	enabling us to estimate selection while explicitly dealing with the
	uncertainty of individual alignments. We show that in this way we
	obtain un-biased selection parameters for different genomic regions
	of interest, and can improve in accuracy compared to using a fixed
	alignment. RESULTS: We run a series of simulation studies to gauge
	how well we do in selection estimation, especially in comparison
	to the use of a fixed alignment. We show that the standard practice
	of using a ClustalW alignment can lead to considerable biases and
	that estimation accuracy increases substantially when explicitly
	integrating over the uncertainty in inferred alignments. We even
	manage to compete favourably for general evolutionary distances with
	an alignment produced by GenAl. We subsequently run our method on
	HIV2 and Hepatitis B sequences. CONCLUSION: We propose that marginalizing
	over all alignments, as opposed to using a fixed one, should be considered
	in any parametric inference from divergent sequence data for which
	the alignments are not known with certainty. Moreover, we discover
	in HIV2 that double coding regions appear to be under less stringent
	selection than single coding ones. Additionally, there appears to
	be evidence for differential selection, where one overlapping reading
	frame is under positive and the other under negative selection.},

	formulated by Thorne, Kishino, and Felsenstein in 1991 (the TKF91
	model), provides a basis for performing alignment within a statistical
	framework. Here we investigate this model.Firstly, we show how to
	accelerate the statistical alignment algorithms several orders of
	magnitude. The main innovations are to confine likelihood calculations
	to a band close to the similarity based alignment, to get good initial
	guesses of the evolutionary parameters and to apply an efficient
	numerical optimisation algorithm for finding the maximum likelihood
	estimate. In addition, the recursions originally presented by Thorne,
	Kishino and Felsenstein can be simplified. Two proteins, about 1500
	amino acids long, can be analysed with this method in less than five
	seconds on a fast desktop computer, which makes this method practical
	for actual data analysis.Secondly, we propose a new homology test
	based on this model, where homology means that an ancestor to a sequence
	pair can be found finitely far back in time. This test has statistical
	advantages relative to the traditional shuffle test for proteins.Finally,
	we describe a goodness-of-fit test, that allows testing the proposed
	insertion-deletion (indel) process inherent to this model and find

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, in the form
	of the Baum-Welch algorithm (for hidden Markov models) or the Inside-Outside
	algorithm (for stochastic context-free grammars), is a powerful way
	to estimate the parameters of stochastic grammars for biological
	sequence analysis. To use this algorithm for multiple-sequence evolutionary
	modelling, it would be useful to apply the EM algorithm to estimate
	not only the probability parameters of the stochastic grammar, but
	also the instantaneous mutation rates of the underlying evolutionary
	model (to facilitate the development of stochastic grammars based
	on phylogenetic trees, also known as Statistical Alignment). Recently,
	we showed how to do this for the point substitution component of
	the evolutionary process; here, we extend these results to the indel
	process. RESULTS: We present an algorithm for maximum-likelihood
	estimation of insertion and deletion rates from multiple sequence
	alignments, using EM, under the single-residue indel model owing
	to Thorne, Kishino and Felsenstein (the 'TKF91' model). The algorithm
	converges extremely rapidly, gives accurate results on simulated
	data that are an improvement over parsimonious estimates (which are
	shown to underestimate the true indel rate), and gives plausible
	results on experimental data (coronavirus envelope domains). Owing
	to the algorithm's close similarity to the Baum-Welch algorithm for
	training hidden Markov models, it can be used in an 'unsupervised'
	fashion to estimate rates for unaligned sequences, or estimate several
	sets of rates for sequences with heterogenous rates. AVAILABILITY:

  title = {Bayesian coestimation of phylogeny and sequence alignment.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {83},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two central problems in computational biology are the
	determination of the alignment and phylogeny of a set of biological
	sequences. The traditional approach to this problem is to first build
	a multiple alignment of these sequences, followed by a phylogenetic
	reconstruction step based on this multiple alignment. However, alignment
	and phylogenetic inference are fundamentally interdependent, and
	ignoring this fact leads to biased and overconfident estimations.
	Whether the main interest be in sequence alignment or phylogeny,
	a major goal of computational biology is the co-estimation of both.
	RESULTS: We developed a fully Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method
	for coestimating phylogeny and sequence alignment, under the Thorne-Kishino-Felsenstein
	model of substitution and single nucleotide insertion-deletion (indel)
	events. In our earlier work, we introduced a novel and efficient
	algorithm, termed the "indel peeling algorithm", which includes indels
	as phylogenetically informative evolutionary events, and resembles
	Felsenstein's peeling algorithm for substitutions on a phylogenetic
	tree. For a fixed alignment, our extension analytically integrates
	out both substitution and indel events within a proper statistical
	model, without the need for data augmentation at internal tree nodes,
	allowing for efficient sampling of tree topologies and edge lengths.
	To additionally sample multiple alignments, we here introduce an
	efficient partial Metropolized independence sampler for alignments,
	and combine these two algorithms into a fully Bayesian co-estimation
	procedure for the alignment and phylogeny problem. Our approach results
	in estimates for the posterior distribution of evolutionary rate
	parameters, for the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) phylogenetic tree,
	and for the posterior decoding alignment. Estimates for the evolutionary
	tree and multiple alignment are augmented with confidence estimates
	for each node height and alignment column. Our results indicate that
	the patterns in reliability broadly correspond to structural features
	of the proteins, and thus provides biologically meaningful information
	which is not existent in the usual point-estimate of the alignment.
	Our methods can handle input data of moderate size (10-20 protein
	sequences, each 100-200 bp), which we analyzed overnight on a standard
	2 GHz personal computer. CONCLUSION: Joint analysis of multiple sequence
	alignment, evolutionary trees and additional evolutionary parameters
	can be now done within a single coherent statistical framework.},

  abstract = {Sequence alignment underpins all of comparative genomics, yet it remains
	an incompletely solved problem. In particular, the statistical uncertainty
	within inferred alignments is often disregarded, while parametric
	or phylogenetic inferences are considered meaningless without confidence
	estimates. Here, we report on a theoretical and simulation study
	of pairwise alignments of genomic DNA at human-mouse divergence.
	We find that >15\% of aligned bases are incorrect in existing whole-genome
	alignments, and we identify three types of alignment error, each
	leading to systematic biases in all algorithms considered. Careful
	modeling of the evolutionary process improves alignment quality;
	however, these improvements are modest compared with the remaining
	alignment errors, even with exact knowledge of the evolutionary model,
	emphasizing the need for statistical approaches to account for uncertainty.
	We develop a new algorithm, Marginalized Posterior Decoding (MPD),
	which explicitly accounts for uncertainties, is less biased and more
	accurate than other algorithms we consider, and reduces the proportion
	of misaligned bases by a third compared with the best existing algorithm.
	To our knowledge, this is the first nonheuristic algorithm for DNA
	sequence alignment to show robust improvements over the classic Needleman-Wunsch
	algorithm. Despite this, considerable uncertainty remains even in
	the improved alignments. We conclude that a probabilistic treatment
	is essential, both to improve alignment quality and to quantify the
	remaining uncertainty. This is becoming increasingly relevant with
	the growing appreciation of the importance of noncoding DNA, whose
	study relies heavily on alignments. Alignment errors are inevitable,
	and should be considered when drawing conclusions from alignments.

	to improve the accuracy of gene prediction programs. Generalized
	pair hidden Markov models (GPHMMs) have been proposed as one means
	to address this need. However, all GPHMM implementations currently
	available are either closed-source or the details of their operation
	are not fully described in the literature, leaving a significant
	hurdle for others wishing to advance the state of the art in GPHMM
	design. RESULTS: We have developed an open-source GPHMM gene finder,
	TWAIN, which performs very well on two related Aspergillus species,
	A.fumigatus and A.nidulans, finding 89\% of the exons and predicting
	74\% of the gene models exactly correctly in a test set of 147 conserved
	gene pairs. We describe the implementation of this GPHMM and we explicitly
	address the assumptions and limitations of the system. We suggest
	possible ways of relaxing those assumptions to improve the utility
	of the system without sacrificing efficiency beyond what is practical.

  abstract = {Motivation: The topic of this paper is the estimation of alignments
	and mutation rates based on stochastic sequence-evolution models
	that allow insertions and deletions of subsequences ('fragments')
	and not just single bases. The model we propose is a variant of a
	model introduced by Thorne et al., (J. Mol. Evol., 34, 3-16, 1992).
	The computational tractability of the model depends on certain restrictions
	in the insertion/deletion process; possible effects we discuss. Results:
	The process of fragment insertion and deletion in the sequence-evolution
	model induces a hidden Markov structure at the level of alignments
	and thus makes possible efficient statistical alignment algorithms.
	As an example we apply a sampling procedure to assess the variability
	in alignment and mutation parameter estimates for HVR1 sequences
	of human and orangutan, improving results of previous work. Simulation
	studies give evidence that estimation methods based on the proposed
	model also give satisfactory results when applied to data for which
	the restrictions in the insertion/deletion process do not hold. Availability:

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {137},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative methods have been the standard techniques
	for in silico protein structure prediction. The prediction is based
	on a multiple alignment that contains both reference sequences with
	known structures and the sequence whose unknown structure is predicted.
	Intensive research has been made to improve the quality of multiple
	alignments, since misaligned parts of the multiple alignment yield
	misleading predictions. However, sometimes all methods fail to predict
	the correct alignment, because the evolutionary signal is too weak
	to find the homologous parts due to the large number of mutations
	that separate the sequences. RESULTS: Stochastic sequence alignment
	methods define a posterior distribution of possible multiple alignments.
	They can highlight the most likely alignment, and above that, they
	can give posterior probabilities for each alignment column. We made
	a comprehensive study on the HOMSTRAD database of structural alignments,
	predicting secondary structures in four different ways. We showed
	that alignment posterior probabilities correlate with the reliability
	of secondary structure predictions, though the strength of the correlation
	is different for different protocols. The correspondence between
	the reliability of secondary structure predictions and alignment
	posterior probabilities is the closest to the identity function when
	the secondary structure posterior probabilities are calculated from
	the posterior distribution of multiple alignments. The largest deviation
	from the identity function has been obtained in the case of predicting
	secondary structures from a single optimal pairwise alignment. We
	also showed that alignment posterior probabilities correlate with
	the 3D distances between C alpha amino acids in superimposed tertiary
	structures. CONCLUSION: Alignment posterior probabilities can be
	used to a priori detect errors in comparative models on the sequence
	alignment level.},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {471},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There have been many algorithms and software programs
	implemented for the inference of multiple sequence alignments of
	protein and DNA sequences. The "true" alignment is usually unknown
	due to the incomplete knowledge of the evolutionary history of the
	sequences, making it difficult to gauge the relative accuracy of
	the programs. RESULTS: We tested nine of the most often used protein
	alignment programs and compared their results using sequences generated
	with the simulation software Simprot which creates known alignments
	under realistic and controlled evolutionary scenarios. We have simulated
	more than 30,000 alignment sets using various evolutionary histories
	in order to define strengths and weaknesses of each program tested.
	We found that alignment accuracy is extremely dependent on the number
	of insertions and deletions in the sequences, and that indel size
	has a weaker effect. We also considered benchmark alignments from
	the latest version of BAliBASE and the results relative to BAliBASE-
	and Simprot-generated data sets were consistent in most cases. CONCLUSION:
	Our results indicate that employing Simprot's simulated sequences
	allows the creation of a more flexible and broader range of alignment
	classes than the usual methods for alignment accuracy assessment.
	Simprot also allows for a quick and efficient analysis of a wider
	range of possible evolutionary histories that might not be present
	in currently available alignment sets. Among the nine programs tested,
	the iterative approach available in Mafft (L-INS-i) and ProbCons
	were consistently the most accurate, with Mafft being the faster

  abstract = {The discovery and analysis of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in metazoan

	sequence comparison holds much promise for improving computational
	prediction of CRMs, for elucidating their binding site composition,
	and for understanding how they evolve. Current methods for analyzing
	orthologous CRMs from multiple species rely upon sequence alignments
	produced by off-the-shelf alignment algorithms, which do not exploit
	the presence of binding sites in the sequences. We present here a
	unified probabilistic framework, called MORPH, that integrates the
	alignment task with binding site predictions, allowing more robust

	alignments of two sequences, thus accounting for alignment ambiguities
	in a natural way. We perform extensive tests on orthologous CRMs
	from two moderately diverged species Drosophila melanogaster and
	D. mojavensis, to demonstrate the advantages of the new approach.
	We show that it can overcome certain computational artifacts of traditional
	alignment tools and provide a different, likely more accurate, picture

	The burgeoning field of cis-regulatory evolution, which is amply
	supported by the availability of many related genomes, is currently
	thwarted by the lack of accurate alignments of regulatory regions.
