  abstract = {Many data sets one could use for population genetics contain artifactual
	sites, i.e., sequencing errors. Here, we first explore the impact
	of such errors on several common summary statistics, assuming that
	sequencing errors are mostly singletons. We thus show that in the
	presence of those errors, estimators of can be strongly biased. We
	further show that even with a moderate number of sequencing errors,
	neutrality tests based on the frequency spectrum reject neutrality.
	This implies that analyses of data sets with such errors will systematically
	lead to wrong inferences of evolutionary scenarios. To avoid to these
	errors, we propose two new estimators of theta that ignore singletons
	as well as two new tests Y and Y* that can be used to test neutrality
	despite sequencing errors. All in all, we show that even though singletons
	are ignored, these new tests show some power to detect deviations
	from a standard neutral model. We therefore advise the use of these
	new tests to strengthen conclusions in suspicious data sets.},

	neutrality for varying levels of mutation and selection as well as
	the robustness of the LRT to deviations from the assumption of free
	recombination among sites. We also discuss the coverage of confidence

	that the LRT has high power to detect deviations from neutrality
	and that the maximum-likelihood estimation performs very well when
	the ancestral states of all mutations in the sample are known. When
	the ancestral states are not known, the test has high power to detect
	deviations from neutrality for negative selection but not for positive
	selection. We also find that the LRT is not robust to deviations

  abstract = {Several tests have been proposed to detect departures of nucleotide
	variability patterns from neutral expectations. However, very different
	kinds of evolutionary processes, such as selective events or demographic
	changes, can produce similar deviations from these tests, thus making
	interpretation difficult when a significant departure of neutrality
	is detected. Here we study the effects of demography and recombination
	upon neutrality tests by analyzing their power under sudden population
	expansions, sudden contractions, and bottlenecks. We evaluate tests
	based on the frequency spectrum of mutations and the distribution
	of haplotypes and explore the consequences of using incorrect estimates
	of the rates of recombination when testing for neutrality. We show
	that tests that rely on haplotype frequencies-especially Fs and ZnS,
	which are based, respectively, on the number of different haplotypes
	and on the r2 values between all pairs of polymorphic sites-are the
	most powerful for detecting expansions on nonrecombining genomic
	regions. Nevertheless, they are strongly affected by misestimations
	of recombination, so they should not be used when recombination levels
	are unknown. Instead, class I tests, particularly Tajima's D or R2,
	are recommended.},

	It is proposed that for a population comprising numerous local populations

	be applied separately to samples from each local population. At low
	levels of gene flow, migration acts primarily like mutation, introducing
	new alleles to each local population. It is shown with simulation
	results that, at low levels of migration, correlations in allele
	frequencies among demes are sufficiently small that the results from
	the application of Ewens' theory to each deme are statistically independent.
	It is also shown that, by combining the results of the tests in different
	demes, some statistical power to detect deviations from neutrality
	is gained. The method is illustrated with the application to data
	on a salamander species. At low levels of gene flow, population subdivision
	must be taken account of in testing neutrality and the proposed test
	provides one way to do so.},

	silent and replacement substitutions in the transmembrane portion
	of the COII molecule, and silent and replacement substitutions in
	the cytosolic portion. Three tree topological mutational categories
	are used: intraspecific tips, intraspecific interiors, and interspecific

	mutations in the cytosolic portion are deleterious, and replacement
	mutations in the transmembrane portion and silent mutations throughout
	tend to be neutral. These conclusions are robust to ambiguities in
	tree topology and branch lengths. These inferences would have been
	impossible with an analysis that only contrasts silent and replacement
	vs. polymorphic and fixed. Also, intraspecific interior mutations

	tip and interior mutations into a single "polymorphic" class reduces
