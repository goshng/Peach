  abstract = {A new approach to assigning individuals to populations using genetic
	data is described. Most existing methods work by maximizing Hardy-Weinberg
	and linkage equilibrium within populations, neither of which will
	apply for many demographic histories. By including a demographic
	model, within a likelihood framework based on coalescent theory,
	we can jointly study demographic history and population assignment.
	Genealogies and population assignments are sampled from a posterior
	distribution using a general isolation-with-migration model for multiple
	populations. A measure of partition distance between assignments
	facilitates not only the summary of a posterior sample of assignments,
	but also the estimation of the posterior density for the demographic
	history. It is shown that joint estimates of assignment and demographic
	history are possible, including estimation of population phylogeny
	for samples from three populations. The new method is compared to
	results of a widely used assignment method, using simulated and published
	empirical data sets.},

  number = {8},
  month = {Aug},
  abstract = {To investigate the evolutionary impact of protein structure, the experimentally
	determined tertiary structure and the protein-coding DNA sequence
	were collected for each of 1,195 genes. These genes were studied
	via a model of sequence change that explicitly incorporates effects
	on evolutionary rates due to protein tertiary structure. In the model,
	these effects act via the solvent accessibility environments and
	pairwise amino acid interactions that are induced by tertiary structure.
	To compare the hypotheses that structure does and does not have a
	strong influence on evolution, Bayes factors were estimated for each
	of the 1,195 sequences. Most of the Bayes factors strongly support
	the hypothesis that protein structure affects protein evolution.
	Furthermore, both solvent accessibility and pairwise interactions
	among amino acids are inferred to have important roles in protein
	evolution. Our results also indicate that the strength of the relationship
	between tertiary structure and evolution has a weak but real correlation
	to the annotation information in the Gene Ontology database. Although
	their influences on rates of evolution vary among protein families,
	we find that the mean impacts of solvent accessibility and pairwise
	interactions are about the same.},

  abstract = {Models of molecular evolution tend to be overly simplistic caricatures
	of biology that are prone to assigning high probabilities to biologically
	implausible DNA or protein sequences. Here, we explore how to construct
	time-reversible evolutionary models that yield stationary distributions
	of sequences that match given target distributions. By adopting comparatively
	realistic target distributions,evolutionary models can be improved.
	Instead of focusing on estimating parameters, we concentrate on the
	population genetic implications of these models. Specifically, we
	obtain estimates of the product of effective population size and
	relative fitness difference of alleles. The approach is illustrated
	with two applications to protein-coding DNA. In the first, a codon-based
	evolutionary model yields a stationary distribution of sequences,
	which, when the sequences are translated,matches a variable-length
	Markov model trained on human proteins. In the second, we introduce
	an insertion-deletion model that describes selectively neutral evolutionary
	changes to DNA. We then show how to modify the neutral model so that
	its stationary distribution at the amino acid level can match a profile
	hidden Markov model, such as the one associated with the Pfam database.},

  abstract = {We consider the inference of which of two alleles is ancestral when
	the alleles have a single nonsynonymous difference and when natural
	selection acts via protein tertiary structure. Whereas the probability
	that an allele is ancestral under neutrality is equal to its frequency,
	under selection this probability depends on allele frequency and
	on the magnitude and direction of selection pressure. Although allele
	frequencies can be well estimated from intraspecific data, small
	fitness differences have a large evolutionary impact but can be difficult
	to estimate with only intraspecific data. Methods for predicting
	aspects of phenotype from genotype can supplement intraspecific sequence
	data. Recently developed statistical techniques can assess effects
	of phenotypes, such as protein tertiary structure on molecular evolution.
	While these techniques were initially designed for comparing protein-coding
	genes from different species, the resulting interspecific inferences
	can be assigned population genetic interpretations to assess the
	effect of selection pressure, and we use them here along with intraspecific
	allele frequency data to estimate the probability that an allele
	is ancestral. We focus on 140 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms
	of humans that are in proteins with known tertiary structures. We
	find that our technique for employing protein tertiary structure
	information yields some biologically plausible results but that it
	does not substantially improve the inference of ancestral human allele
	types.},

  abstract = {A central goal of computational biology is the prediction of phenotype
	from DNA and protein sequence data. Recent models of sequence change
	use in silico prediction systems to incorporate the effects of phenotype
	on evolutionary rates. These models have been designed for analyzing
	sequence data from different species and have been accompanied by
	statistical techniques for estimating model parameters when the incorporation
	of phenotype induces dependent change among sequence positions. A
	difficulty with these efforts to link phenotype and interspecific
	evolution is that evolution occurs within populations, and parameters
	of interspecific models should have population genetic interpretations.
	We show, with two examples, how population genetic interpretations
	can be assigned to evolutionary models. The first example considers
	the impact of RNA secondary structure on sequence change, and the
	second reflects the tendency for protein tertiary structure to influence
	nonsynonymous substitution rates. We argue that statistical fit to
	data should not be the sole criterion for assessing models of sequence
	change. A good interspecific model should also yield a clear and
	biologically plausible population genetic interpretation.},
