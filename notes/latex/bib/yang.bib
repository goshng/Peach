  abstract = {A major part of the barcoding of life problem is assigning newly sequenced
	or sampled individuals to existing groups that are preidentified
	externally (by a taxonomist, for example). This problem involves
	evaluating the statistical evidence towards associating a sequence
	from a new individual with one group or another. The main concern
	of our current research is to perform this task in a fast and accurate
	manner. To accomplish this we have developed a model-based, decision-theoretic
	framework based on the coalescent theory. Under this framework, we
	utilized both distance and the posterior probability of a group,
	given the sequences from members of this group and the sequence from
	a newly sampled individual to assign this new individual. We believe
	that this approach makes efficient use of the available information
	in the data. Our preliminary results indicated that this approach
	is more accurate than using a simple measure of distance for assignment.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive dataset of 62 beta globin gene sequences from various
	vertebrates was compiled to test the molecular clock and to estimate
	dates of gene duplications. We found that evolution of the beta globin
	family of genes is not clock-like, a result that is at odds with
	the common use of this family as an example of a constant rate of
	evolution over time. Divergence dates were estimated either with
	or without assuming the molecular clock, and both analyses produced
	similar date estimates, which are also in general agreement with
	estimates reported previously. In addition we report date estimates
	for seven previously unexamined duplication events within the beta
	globin family. Despite multiple sources of rate variation, the average
	rate across the beta globin phylogeny yielded reasonable estimates
	of divergence dates in most cases. Exceptions were cases of gene
	conversion, where it appears to have led to underestimates of divergence
	dates. Our results suggest (i) the major duplications giving rise
	to the paralogous beta globin genes are associated with significant
	evolutionary rate variation among gene lineages; and (ii) genes arising
	from more recent gene duplications (e.g., tandem duplications within
	lineages) do not appear to differ greatly in rate. We believe this
	pattern reflects a complex interplay of evolutionary forces where
	natural selection for diversifying paralogous functions and lineage-specific
	effects contribute to rate variation on a long-term basis, while
	gene conversion tends to increase sequence similarity. Gene conversion
	effects appear to be stronger on recent gene duplicates, as their
	sequences are highly similar. Lastly, phylogenetic analyses do not
	support a previous report that avian globins are members of a relic
	lineage of omega globins.},

  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {154},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In comparative analyses of bacterial pathogens, it has
	been common practice to discriminate between two types of genes:
	(i) those shared by pathogens and their non-pathogenic relatives
	(core genes), and (ii) those found exclusively in pathogens (pathogen-specific
	accessory genes). Rather than attempting to a priori delineate genes
	into sets more or less relevant to pathogenicity, we took a broad
	approach to the analysis of Streptococcus species by investigating
	the strength of natural selection in all clusters of homologous genes.
	The genus Streptococcus is comprised of a wide variety of both pathogenic
	and commensal lineages, and we relate our findings to the pre-existing
	knowledge of Streptococcus virulence factors. RESULTS: Our analysis
	of 1730 gene clusters revealed 136 cases of positive Darwinian selection,
	which we suggest is most likely to result from an antagonistic interaction
	between the host and pathogen at the molecular level. A two-step
	validation procedure suggests that positive selection was robustly
	identified in our genomic survey. We found no evidence to support
	the notion that pathogen specific accessory genes are more likely
	to be subject to positive selection than core genes. Indeed, we even
	uncovered a few cases of essential gene evolution by positive selection.
	Among the gene clusters subject to positive selection, a large fraction
	(29\%) can be connected to virulence. The most striking finding was
	that a considerable fraction of the positively selected genes are
	also known to have tissue specific patterns of expression during
	invasive disease. As current expression data is far from comprehensive,
	we suggest that this fraction was underestimated. CONCLUSION: Our
	findings suggest that pathogen specific genes, although a popular
	focus of research, do not provide a complete picture of the evolutionary
	dynamics of virulence. The results of this study, and others, support
	the notion that the products of both core and accessory genes participate
	in complex networks that comprise the molecular basis of virulence.
	Future work should seek to understand the evolutionary dynamics of
	both core and accessory genes as a function of the networks in which
	they participate.},

	It was used to identify amino acids in a protein under recurrent
	diversifying selection indicated by higher nonsynonymous (d(N)) than
	synonymous (d(S)) substitution rates or by omega = d(N)/d(S) > 1.
	Parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood under a codon substitution
	model that assumed several classes of sites with different omega
	ratios. The Bayes theorem was used to calculate the posterior probabilities
	of each site falling into these site classes. Here, we evaluate the
	performance of Bayes prediction of amino acids under positive selection
	by computer simulation. We measured the accuracy by the proportion
	of predicted sites that were truly under selection and the power
	by the proportion of true positively selected sites that were predicted
	by the method. The accuracy was slightly better for longer sequences,
	whereas the power was largely unaffected by the increase in sequence
	length. Both accuracy and power were higher for medium or highly
	diverged sequences than for similar sequences. We found that accuracy
	and power were unacceptably low when data contained only a few highly
	similar sequences. However, sampling a large number of lineages improved
	the performance substantially. Even for very similar sequences, accuracy
	and power can be high if over 100 taxa are used in the analysis.
	We make the following recommendations: (1) prediction of positive
	selection sites is not feasible for a few closely related sequences;
	(2) using a large number of lineages is the best way to improve the
	accuracy and power of the prediction; and (3) multiple models of
	heterogeneous selective pressures among sites should be applied in

	be powerful in detecting positive selection in protein-coding DNA
	sequences. Those methods are phylogeny based and do not account for
	the effects of recombination. When recombination occurs, such as
	in population data, no unique tree topology can describe the evolutionary
	history of the whole sequence. This violation of assumptions raises
	serious concerns about the likelihood method for detecting positive
	selection. Here we use computer simulation to evaluate the reliability
	of the likelihood-ratio test (LRT) for positive selection in the
	presence of recombination. We examine three tests based on different
	models of variable selective pressures among sites. Sequences are
	simulated using a coalescent model with recombination and analyzed
	using codon-based likelihood models ignoring recombination. We find
	that the LRT is robust to low levels of recombination (with fewer
	than three recombination events in the history of a sample of 10
	sequences). However, at higher levels of recombination, the type
	I error rate can be as high as 90\%, especially when the null model
	in the LRT is unrealistic, and the test often mistakes recombination
	as evidence for positive selection. The test that compares the more
	realistic models M7 (beta) against M8 (beta and omega) is more robust
	to recombination, where the null model M7 allows the positive selection
	pressure to vary between 0 and 1 (and so does not account for positive
	selection), and the alternative model M8 allows an additional discrete
	class with omega = d(N)/d(S) that could be estimated to be >1 (and
	thus accounts for positive selection). Identification of sites under
	positive selection by the empirical Bayes method appears to be less
	affected than the LRT by recombination.},

  abstract = {Detection of positive Darwinian selection has become ever more important
	with the rapid growth of genomic data sets. Recent branch-site models
	of codon substitution account for variation of selective pressure
	over branches on the tree and across sites in the sequence and provide
	a means to detect short episodes of molecular adaptation affecting
	just a few sites. In likelihood ratio tests based on such models,
	the branches to be tested for positive selection have to be specified
	a priori. In the absence of a biological hypothesis to designate
	so-called foreground branches, one may test many branches, but a
	correction for multiple testing becomes necessary. In this paper,
	we employ computer simulation to evaluate the performance of 6 multiple
	test correction procedures when the branch-site models are used to
	test every branch on the phylogeny for positive selection. Four of
	the methods control the familywise error rates (FWERs), whereas the
	other 2 control the false discovery rate (FDR). We found that all
	correction procedures achieved acceptable FWER except for extremely
	divergent sequences and serious model violations, when the test may
	become unreliable. The power of the test to detect positive selection
	is influenced by the strength of selection and the sequence divergence,
	with the highest power observed at intermediate divergences. The
	4 correction procedures that control the FWER had similar power.
	We recommend Rom's procedure for its slightly higher power, but the
	simple Bonferroni correction is useable as well. The 2 correction
	procedures that control the FDR had slightly more power and also
	higher FWER. We demonstrate the multiple test procedures by analyzing
	gene sequences from the extracellular domain of the cluster of differentiation
	2 (CD2) gene from 10 mammalian species. Both our simulation and real
	data analysis suggest that the multiple test procedures are useful
	when multiple branches have to be tested on the same data set.},

	575 and 509 million years ago (MYA). At odds with paleontological
	evidence, molecular estimates of basal metazoan divergences have
	been consistently older than 700 MYA. However, those date estimates
	were based on the molecular clock hypothesis, which is almost always
	violated. To relax this hypothesis, we have implemented a Bayesian
	approach to describe the change of evolutionary rate over time. Analysis
	of 22 genes from the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes under
	the molecular clock assumption produced old date estimates, similar
	to those from previous studies. However, by allowing rates to vary
	in time and by taking small species-sampling fractions into account,
	we obtained much younger estimates, broadly consistent with the fossil
	records. In particular, the date of protostome-deuterostome divergence
	was on average 582 +/- 112 MYA. These results were found to be robust
	to specification of the model of rate change. The clock assumption
	thus had a dramatic effect on date estimation. However, our results
	appeared sensitive to the prior model of cladogenesis, although the
	oldest estimates (791 +/- 246 MYA) were obtained under a suboptimal
	model. Bayes posterior estimates of evolutionary rates indicated
	at least one major burst of molecular evolution at the end of the
	Precambrian when protostomes and deuterostomes diverged. We stress
	the importance of assumptions about rates on date estimation and
	suggest that the large discrepancies between the molecular and fossil

	this assumption is often violated and has drastic effects on date
	estimation. Recently, a number of attempts have been made to relax
	the clock assumption. One approach is to use maximum likelihood,
	which assigns rates to branches and allows the estimation of both
	rates and times. An alternative is the Bayes approach, which models
	the change of the rate over time. A number of models of rate change
	have been proposed. We have extended and evaluated models of rate
	evolution, i.e., the lognormal and its recent variant, along with
	the gamma, the exponential, and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.
	These models were first applied to a small hominoid data set, where
	an empirical Bayes approach was used to estimate the hyperparameters
	that measure the amount of rate variation. Estimation of divergence
	times was sensitive to these hyperparameters, especially when the
	assumed model is close to the clock assumption. The rate and date
	estimates varied little from model to model, although the posterior
	Bayes factor indicated the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process outperformed
	the other models. To demonstrate the importance of allowing for rate
	change across lineages, this general approach was used to analyze
	a larger data set consisting of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene of 39
	metazoan species. We obtained date estimates consistent with paleontological
	records, the deepest split within the group being about 560 million

	co-option. Mechanisms of genetic co-option have been difficult to
	study because of difficulties in identifying functionally important
	changes. One way to study genetic co-option in protein-coding genes
	is to identify those amino acid sites that have experienced changes
	in selective pressure following a genetic co-option event. In this
	paper we present a maximum likelihood method useful for measuring
	divergent selective pressures and identifying the amino acid sites
	affected by divergent selection. The method is based on a codon model
	of evolution and uses the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate ratio
	(omega) as a measure of selection on the protein, with omega = 1,
	< 1, and > 1 indicating neutral evolution, purifying selection, and
	positive selection, respectively. The model allows variation in omega
	among sites, with a fraction of sites evolving under divergent selective
	pressures. Divergent selection is indicated by different omega's
	between clades, such as between paralogous clades of a gene family.
	We applied the codon model to duplication followed by functional
	divergence of (i) the epsilon and gamma globin genes and (ii) the
	eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin
	(EDN) genes. In both cases likelihood ratio tests suggested the presence
	of sites evolving under divergent selective pressures. Results of
	the epsilon and gamma globin analysis suggested that divergent selective
	pressures might be a consequence of a weakened relationship between
	fetal hemoglobin and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. We suggest that empirical
	Bayesian identification of sites evolving under divergent selective
	pressures, combined with structural and functional information, can
	provide a valuable framework for identifying and studying mechanisms

	process with species sampling. The prior for lineage-specific substitution
	rates is specified using either a model with autocorrelated rates
	among adjacent lineages (based on a geometric Brownian motion model
	of rate drift) or a model with independent rates among lineages specified
	by a log-normal probability distribution. We develop an infinite-sites
	theory, which predicts that when the amount of sequence data approaches
	infinity, the width of the posterior credibility interval and the
	posterior mean of divergence times form a perfect linear relationship,
	with the slope indicating uncertainties in time estimates that cannot
	be reduced by sequence data alone. Simulations are used to study
	the influence of among-lineage rate variation and the number of loci
	sampled on the uncertainty of divergence time estimates. The analysis
	suggests that posterior time estimates typically involve considerable
	uncertainties even with an infinite amount of sequence data, and
	that the reliability and precision of fossil calibrations are critically
	important to divergence time estimation. We apply our new algorithms
	to two empirical data sets and compare the results with those obtained
	in previous Bayesian and likelihood analyses. The results demonstrate
	the utility of our new algorithms.},

	method for simultaneous estimation of the species divergence times

	data from multiple loci and extracts information about conflicts
	among gene tree topologies and coalescent times to estimate ancestral
	population sizes. The topology of the species tree is assumed known.
	A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is implemented to integrate
	over uncertain gene trees and branch lengths (or coalescence times)
	at each locus as well as species divergence times. The method can
	handle any species tree and allows different numbers of sequences
	at different loci. We apply the method to published noncoding DNA
	sequences from the human and the great apes. There are strong correlations
	between posterior estimates of speciation times and ancestral population
	sizes. With the use of an informative prior for the human-chimpanzee
	divergence date, the population size of the common ancestor of the
	two species is estimated to be approximately 20,000, with a 95\%
	credibility interval (8000, 40,000). Our estimates, however, are
	affected by model assumptions as well as data quality. We suggest

	DNA sequences and are particularly effective in detecting signals
	of natural selection acting on the protein. Their utility in reconstructing
	molecular phylogenies and in dating species divergences has not been
	explored. Codon models naturally accommodate synonymous and nonsynonymous
	substitutions, which occur at very different rates and may be informative
	for recent and ancient divergences, respectively. Thus codon models
	may be expected to make an efficient use of phylogenetic information
	in protein-coding DNA sequences. Here we applied codon models to
	106 protein-coding genes from eight yeast species to reconstruct
	phylogenies using the maximum likelihood method, in comparison with
	nucleotide- and amino acid-based analyses. The results appeared to
	confirm that expectation. Nucleotide-based analysis, under simplistic
	substitution models, were efficient in recovering recent divergences
	whereas amino acid-based analysis performed better at recovering
	deep divergences. Codon models appeared to combine the advantages
	of amino acid and nucleotide data and had good performance at recovering
	both recent and deep divergences. Estimation of relative species
	divergence times using amino acid and codon models suggested that
	translation of gene sequences into proteins led to information loss
	of from 30\% for deep nodes to 66\% for recent nodes. Although computational
	burden makes codon models unfeasible for tree search in large data
	sets, we suggest that they may be useful for comparing candidate
	trees. Nucleotide models that accommodate the differences in evolutionary
	dynamics at the three codon positions also performed well, at much
	less computational cost. We discuss the relationship between a model's
	fit to data and its utility in phylogeny reconstruction and caution

  abstract = {The star-tree paradox refers to the conjecture that the posterior
	probabilities for the three unrooted trees for four species (or the
	three rooted trees for three species if the molecular clock is assumed)
	do not approach 1/3 when the data are generated using the star tree
	and when the amount of data approaches infinity. It reflects the
	more general phenomenon of high and presumably spurious posterior
	probabilities for trees or clades produced by the Bayesian method
	of phylogenetic reconstruction, and it is perceived to be a manifestation
	of the deeper problem of the extreme sensitivity of Bayesian model
	selection to the prior on parameters. Analysis of the star-tree paradox
	has been hampered by the intractability of the integrals involved.
	In this article, I use Laplacian expansion to approximate the posterior
	probabilities for the three rooted trees for three species using
	binary characters evolving at a constant rate. The approximation
	enables calculation of posterior tree probabilities for arbitrarily
	large data sets. Both theoretical analysis of the analogous fair-coin
	and fair-balance problems and computer simulation for the tree problem
	confirmed the existence of the star-tree paradox. When the data size
	n --> infinity, the posterior tree probabilities do not converge
	to 1/3 each, but they vary among data sets according to a statistical
	distribution. This distribution is characterized. Two strategies
	for resolving the star-tree paradox are explored: (1) a nonzero prior
	probability for the degenerate star tree and (2) an increasingly
	informative prior forcing the internal branch length toward zero.
	Both appear to be effective in resolving the paradox, but the latter
	is simpler to implement. The posterior tree probabilities are found
	to be very sensitive to the prior.},

	Darwinian selection affecting a few amino acid sites in a protein,
	exemplified by an excess of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions.
	These tests are often more powerful than pairwise sequence comparison,
	which averages synonymous (d(S)) and nonsynonymous (d(N)) rates over
	the whole gene. In a recent study, however, Hughes AL and Friedman
	R (2005. Variation in the pattern of synonymous and nonsynonymous
	difference between two fungal genomes. Mol Bio Evol. 22: 1320-1324)
	argue that d(S) and d(N) are expected to fluctuate along the sequence
	by chance and that an excess of nonsynonymous differences in individual
	codons is no evidence for positive selection. The authors compared
	codons in protein-coding genes from the genomes of 2 yeast species,
	Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces paradoxus. They calculated
	the proportions of synonymous and nonsynonymous differences per site
	(p(S) and p(N)) in every codon and discovered that p(N) is often
	greater than p(S) and that among some codons p(S) and p(N) are negatively
	correlated. The authors argued that these results invalidate previous
	tests of codons under positive selection. Here I discuss several
	errors of statistics in the analysis of Hughes and Friedman, including
	confusion of statistics with parameters, arbitrary data filtering,
	and derivation of hypotheses from data. I also apply likelihood ratio
	tests of positive selection to the yeast data and illustrate empirically
	that Hughes and Friedman's criticisms on such tests are not valid.},

  abstract = {Polymorphisms in an ancestral population can cause conflicts between
	gene trees and the species tree. Such conflicts can be used to estimate
	ancestral population sizes when data from multiple loci are available.
	In this article I extend previous work for estimating ancestral population
	sizes to analyze sequence data from three species under a finite-site
	nucleotide substitution model. Both maximum-likelihood (ML) and Bayes
	methods are implemented for joint estimation of the two speciation
	dates and the two population size parameters. Both methods account
	for uncertainties in the gene tree due to few informative sites at
	each locus and make an efficient use of information in the data.
	The Bayes algorithm using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) enjoys
	a computational advantage over ML and also provides a framework for
	incorporating prior information about the parameters. The methods
	are applied to a data set of 53 nuclear noncoding contigs from human,
	chimpanzee, and gorilla published by Chen and Li. Estimates of the
	effective population size for the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees
	by both ML and Bayes methods are approximately 12,000-21,000, comparable
	to estimates for modern humans, and do not support the notion of
	a dramatic size reduction in early human populations. Estimates published
	previously from the same data are several times larger and appear
	to be biased due to methodological deficiency. The divergence between
	humans and chimpanzees is dated at approximately 5.2 million years
	ago and the gorilla divergence 1.1-1.7 million years earlier. The
	analysis suggests that typical data sets contain useful information
	about the ancestral population sizes and that it is advantageous

	A lineage that underwent Darwinian selection may have a nonsynonymous/synonymous

	models that allow for variable dN/dS ratios among lineages were developed.

	whether the ratio for a few lineages of interest is different from

	Previous studies that used this measure to detect positive selection

	mitochondrial, and viral genomes are analyzed to estimate the distributions
	of omega among sites. In all data sets analyzed, the selective pressure
	indicated by the omega ratio is found to be highly heterogeneous
	among sites. Previously unsuspected Darwinian selection is detected
	in several genes in which the average omega ratio across sites is
	<1, but in which some sites are clearly under diversifying selection
	with omega > 1. Genes undergoing positive selection include the beta-globin
	gene from vertebrates, mitochondrial protein-coding genes from hominoids,
	the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from human influenza virus A, and HIV-1
	env, vif, and pol genes. Tests for the presence of positively selected
	sites and their subsequent identification appear quite robust to
	the specific distributional form assumed for omega and can be achieved
	using any of several models we implement. However, we encountered
	difficulties in estimating the precise distribution of omega among
	sites from real data sets.},

  abstract = {We implement a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating
	species divergence times that uses heterogeneous data from multiple
	gene loci and accommodates multiple fossil calibration nodes. A birth-death
	process with species sampling is used to specify a prior for divergence
	times, which allows easy assessment of the effects of that prior
	on posterior time estimates. We propose a new approach for specifying
	calibration points on the phylogeny, which allows the use of arbitrary
	and flexible statistical distributions to describe uncertainties
	in fossil dates. In particular, we use soft bounds, so that the probability
	that the true divergence time is outside the bounds is small but
	nonzero. A strict molecular clock is assumed in the current implementation,
	although this assumption may be relaxed. We apply our new algorithm
	to two data sets concerning divergences of several primate species,
	to examine the effects of the substitution model and of the prior
	for divergence times on Bayesian time estimation. We also conduct
	computer simulation to examine the differences between soft and hard
	bounds. We demonstrate that divergence time estimation is intrinsically
	hampered by uncertainties in fossil calibrations, and the error in
	Bayesian time estimates will not go to zero with increased amounts
	of sequence data. Our analyses of both real and simulated data demonstrate
	potentially large differences between divergence time estimates obtained
	using soft versus hard bounds and a general superiority of soft bounds.
	Our main findings are as follows. (1) When the fossils are consistent
	with each other and with the molecular data, and the posterior time
	estimates are well within the prior bounds, soft and hard bounds
	produce similar results. (2) When the fossils are in conflict with
	each other or with the molecules, soft and hard bounds behave very
	differently; soft bounds allow sequence data to correct poor calibrations,
	while poor hard bounds are impossible to overcome by any amount of
	data. (3) Soft bounds eliminate the need for "safe" but unrealistically
	high upper bounds, which may bias posterior time estimates. (4) Soft
	bounds allow more reliable assessment of estimation errors, while
	hard bounds generate misleadingly high precisions when fossils and
	molecules are in conflict.},

  abstract = {The role of somatic mutation in cancer is well established and several
	genes have been identified that are frequent targets. This has enabled
	large-scale screening studies of the spectrum of somatic mutations
	in cancers of particular organs. Cancer gene mutation databases compile
	the results of many studies and can provide insight into the importance
	of specific amino acid sequences and functional domains in cancer,
	as well as elucidate aspects of the mutation process. Past studies
	of the spectrum of cancer mutations (in particular genes) have examined
	overall frequencies of mutation (at specific nucleotides) and of
	missense, nonsense, and silent substitution (at specific codons)
	both in the sequence as a whole and in a specific functional domain.
	Existing methods ignore features of the genetic code that allow some
	codons to mutate to missense, or stop, codons more readily than others
	(i.e., by one nucleotide change, vs. two or three). A new codon-based
	method to estimate the relative rate of substitution (fixation of
	a somatic mutation in a cancer cell lineage) of nonsense vs. missense
	mutations in different functional domains and in different tumor
	tissues is presented. Models that account for several potential influences
	on rates of somatic mutation and substitution in cancer progenitor
	cells and allow biases of mutation rates for particular dinucleotide
	sequences (CGs and dipyrimidines), transition vs. transversion bias,
	and variable rates of silent substitution across functional domains
	(useful in detecting investigator sampling bias) are considered.
	Likelihood-ratio tests are used to choose among models, using cancer
	gene mutation data. The method is applied to analyze published data
	on the spectrum of p53 mutations in cancers. A novel finding is that
	the ratio of the probability of nonsense to missense substitution
	is much lower in the DNA-binding and transactivation domains (ratios
	near 1) than in structural domains such as the linker, tetramerization
	(oligomerization), and proline-rich domains (ratios exceeding 100
	in some tissues), implying that the specific amino acid sequence
	may be less critical in structural domains (e.g., amino acid changes
	less often lead to cancer). The transition vs. transversion bias
	and effect of CpG dinucleotides on mutation rates in p53 varied greatly
	across cancers of different organs, likely reflecting effects of
	different endogenous and exogenous factors influencing mutation in
	specific organs.},

	likelihood models of codon substitution developed recently account

	a statistical distribution for the omega ratio among sites. Those
	models, called random-sites models, are suitable when we do not know
	a priori which sites are under what kind of selective pressure. Sometimes
	prior information (such as the tertiary structure of the protein)
	might be available to partition sites in the protein into different

	It is then sensible to use such information in the model. In this
	paper, we implement maximum likelihood models for prepartitioned
	data sets, which account for the heterogeneity among site partitions
	by using different omega parameters for the partitions. The models,
	referred to as fixed-sites models, are also useful for combined analysis
	of multiple genes from the same set of species. We apply the models
	to data sets of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class
	I alleles from human populations and of the abalone sperm lysin genes.
	Structural information is used to partition sites in MHC into two
	classes: those in the antigen recognition site (ARS) and those outside.
	Positive selection is detected in the ARS by the fixed-sites models.
	Similarly, sites in lysin are classified into the buried and solvent-exposed
	classes according to the tertiary structure, and positive selection
	was detected at the solvent-exposed sites. The random-sites models
	identified a number of sites under positive selection in each data
	set, confirming and elaborating the results of the fixed-sites models.
	The analysis demonstrates the utility of the fixed-sites models,

  abstract = {Divergence time and substitution rate are seriously confounded in
	phylogenetic analysis, making it difficult to estimate divergence
	times when the molecular clock (rate constancy among lineages) is
	violated. This problem can be alleviated to some extent by analyzing
	multiple gene loci simultaneously and by using multiple calibration
	points. While different genes may have different patterns of evolutionary
	rate change, they share the same divergence times. Indeed, the fact
	that each gene may violate the molecular clock differently leads
	to the advantage of simultaneous analysis of multiple loci. Multiple
	calibration points provide the means for characterizing the local
	evolutionary rates on the phylogeny. In this paper, we extend previous
	likelihood models of local molecular clock for estimating species
	divergence times to accommodate multiple calibration points and multiple
	genes. Heterogeneity among different genes in evolutionary rate and
	in substitution process is accounted for by the models. We apply
	the likelihood models to analyze two mitochondrial protein-coding
	genes, cytochrome oxidase II and cytochrome b, to estimate divergence
	times of Malagasy mouse lemurs and related outgroups. The likelihood
	method is compared with the Bayes method of Thorne et al. (1998,
	Mol. Biol. Evol. 15:1647-1657), which uses a probabilistic model
	to describe the change in evolutionary rate over time and uses the
	Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure to derive the posterior distribution
	of rates and times. Our likelihood implementation has the drawbacks
	of failing to accommodate uncertainties in fossil calibrations and
	of requiring the researcher to classify branches on the tree into
	different rate groups. Both problems are avoided in the Bayes method.
	Despite the differences in the two methods, however, data partitions
	and model assumptions had the greatest impact on date estimation.
	The three codon positions have very different substitution rates
	and evolutionary dynamics, and assumptions in the substitution model
	affect date estimation in both likelihood and Bayes analyses. The
	results demonstrate that the separate analysis is unreliable, with
	dates variable among codon positions and between methods, and that
	the combined analysis is much more reliable. When the three codon
	positions were analyzed simultaneously under the most realistic models
	using all available calibration information, the two methods produced
	similar results. The divergence of the mouse lemurs is dated to be
	around 7-10 million years ago, indicating a surprisingly early species
	radiation for such a morphologically uniform group of primates.},

  abstract = {Detecting positive Darwinian selection at the DNA sequence level has
	been a subject of considerable interest. However, positive selection
	is difficult to detect because it often operates episodically on
	a few amino acid sites, and the signal may be masked by negative
	selection. Several methods have been developed to test positive selection
	that acts on given branches (branch methods) or on a subset of sites
	(site methods). Recently, Yang, Z., and R. Nielsen (2002. Codon-substitution
	models for detecting molecular adaptation at individual sites along
	specific lineages. Mol. Biol. Evol. 19:908-917) developed likelihood
	ratio tests (LRTs) based on branch-site models to detect positive
	selection that affects a small number of sites along prespecified
	lineages. However, computer simulations suggested that the tests
	were sensitive to the model assumptions and were unable to distinguish
	between relaxation of selective constraint and positive selection
	(Zhang, J. 2004. Frequent false detection of positive selection by
	the likelihood method with branch-site models. Mol. Biol. Evol. 21:1332-1339).
	Here, we describe a modified branch-site model and use it to construct
	two LRTs, called branch-site tests 1 and 2. We applied the new tests
	to reanalyze several real data sets and used computer simulation
	to examine the performance of the two tests by examining their false-positive
	rate, power, and robustness. We found that test 1 was unable to distinguish
	relaxed constraint from positive selection affecting the lineages
	of interest, while test 2 had acceptable false-positive rates and
	appeared robust against violations of model assumptions. As test
	2 is a direct test of positive selection on the lineages of interest,
	it is referred to as the branch-site test of positive selection and
	is recommended for use in real data analysis. The test appeared conservative
	overall, but exhibited better power in detecting positive selection
	than the branch-based test. Bayes empirical Bayes identification
	of amino acid sites under positive selection along the foreground
	branches was found to be reliable, but lacked power.},
