  abstract = {We employed a multilocus approach to examine the effects of population
	subdivision and natural selection on DNA polymorphism in 2 closely
	related wild tomato species (Solanum peruvianum and Solanum chilense),
	using sequence data for 8 nuclear loci from populations across much
	of the species' range. Both species exhibit substantial levels of
	nucleotide variation. The species-wide level of silent nucleotide
	diversity is 18\% higher in S. peruvianum (pi(sil) approximately
	2.50\%) than in S. chilense (pi(sil) approximately 2.12\%). One of
	the loci deviates from neutral expectations, showing a clinal pattern
	of nucleotide diversity and haplotype structure in S. chilense. This
	geographic pattern of variation is suggestive of an incomplete (ongoing)
	selective sweep, but neutral explanations cannot be entirely dismissed.
	Both wild tomato species exhibit moderate levels of population differentiation
	(average F(ST) approximately 0.20). Interestingly, the pooled samples
	(across different demes) exhibit more negative Tajima's D and Fu
	and Li's D values; this marked excess of low-frequency polymorphism
	can only be explained by population (or range) expansion and is unlikely
	to be due to population structure per se. We thus propose that population
	structure and population/range expansion are among the most important
	evolutionary forces shaping patterns of nucleotide diversity within
	and among demes in these wild tomatoes. Patterns of population differentiation
	may also be impacted by soil seed banks and historical associations
	mediated by climatic cycles. Intragenic linkage disequilibrium (LD)
	decays very rapidly with physical distance, suggesting high recombination
	rates and effective population sizes in both species. The rapid decline
	of LD seems very promising for future association studies with the
	purpose of mapping functional variation in wild tomatoes.},

  abstract = {Riverine fish populations are traditionally considered to be highly
	structured and subject to strong genetic drift. Here, we use microsatellites
	to analyse the population structure of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata),
	focussing on the headwater floodplain area of the Caroni drainage
	in Trinidad. We also analyse the population genetics of guppies in
	the Northern Drainage in Trinidad, a habitat characterized by rivers
	flowing directly into the sea, and a small isolated population in
	Tobago. Upland Caroni populations are highly differentiated and display
	low levels of genetic diversity. However, we found no evidence to
	suggest that these upland populations experienced recent population
	crashes and the populations appear to approach mutation-drift equilibrium.
	Dominant downstream migration over both short- and long-time frames
	has a strong impact on the population genetics of lowland Caroni
	populations. This drainage system could be considered a source-sink
	metapopulation, with the tributary furthest downstream representing
	a 'super sink', receiving immigrants from rivers upstream in the
	drainage. Moreover, the effective population size in the lowlands
	is surprisingly low in comparison with the apparently large census
	population sizes.},

	Please find attached two microsatellite datasets of four guppy
	
	populations from Trinidad. 
	
	
	The first dataset (Nicky Aripo microsat NEW): I think that the
	
	structuring within these populations is negligible (according to
	
	Structure), and that the divergence is caused by drift in the smallest
	
	population, compensated for by migration from the larger population.
	
	
	
	The second dataset (Nicky UM and MN): This is more interesting for
	you
	
	as here structuring within a large population is possibly confounded
	by
	
	mutations, resulting in size homoplasy. 
	
	
	How does your method differ from IMA and ABC methods?
	
	
	Good luck! Cock

	Dear Dr. Cock van Oosterhout:
	
	
	Thank you for the prompt reply and asking a question for me. Many
	
	methods of population clustering use the equilibrium model to assign
	
	individuals to some populations. One that I want to develop is to
	use
	
	mutation models. I will use a SMM mutation model for microsatellite
	data
	
	and assume two populations split from a common ancestor population
	in
	
	order to do the statistical inference of population assignment. I
	am not
	
	sure whether this would do better than other method such as Structure,
	
	but I hope that adding mutation models may help us do the population
	
	clustering better. Potentially, the method may be able to infer
	
	effective population size, migration, and split time as well as
	
	population assignment.
	
	
	I have found out that many microsatellite datasets are not available
	
	unless I ask authors. Is there any database for microsatellite? 
	
	
	Thank you,
	
	
	Sang Chul

  title = {Genetic structuring and migration patterns of Atlantic bigeye tuna,
	Thunnus obesus (Lowe, 1839).},
  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {252},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large pelagic fishes are generally thought to have little
	population genetic structuring based on their cosmopolitan distribution,
	large population sizes and high dispersal capacities. However, gene
	flow can be influenced by ecological (e.g. homing behaviour) and
	physical (e.g. present-day ocean currents, past changes in sea temperature
	and levels) factors. In this regard, Atlantic bigeye tuna shows an
	interesting genetic structuring pattern with two highly divergent
	mitochondrial clades (Clades I and II), which are assumed to have
	been originated during the last Pleistocene glacial maxima. We assess
	genetic structure patterns of Atlantic bigeye tuna at the nuclear
	level, and compare them with mitochondrial evidence. RESULTS: We
	examined allele size variation of nine microsatellite loci in 380
	individuals from the Gulf of Guinea, Canary, Azores, Canada, Indian
	Ocean, and Pacific Ocean. To investigate temporal stability of genetic
	structure, three Atlantic Ocean sites were re-sampled a second year.
	Hierarchical AMOVA tests, RST pairwise comparisons, isolation by
	distance (Mantel) tests, Bayesian clustering analyses, and coalescence-based
	migration rate inferences supported unrestricted gene flow within
	the Atlantic Ocean at the nuclear level, and therefore interbreeding
	between individuals belonging to both mitochondrial clades. Moreover,
	departures from HWE in several loci were inferred for the samples
	of Guinea, and attributed to a Wahlund effect supporting the role
	of this region as a spawning and nursery area. Our microsatellite
	data supported a single worldwide panmictic unit for bigeye tunas.
	Despite the strong Agulhas Current, immigration rates seem to be
	higher from the Atlantic Ocean into the Indo-Pacific Ocean, but the
	actual number of individuals moving per generation is relatively
	low compared to the large population sizes inhabiting each ocean
	basin. CONCLUSION: Lack of congruence between mt and nuclear evidences,
	which is also found in other species, most likely reflects past events
	of isolation and secondary contact. Given the inferred relatively
	low number of immigrants per generation around the Cape of Good Hope,
	the proportions of the mitochondrial clades in the different oceans
	may keep stable, and it seems plausible that the presence of individuals
	belonging to the mt Clade I in the Atlantic Ocean may be due to extensive
	migrations that predated the last glaciation.},

  abstract = {The nosocomial human pathogen Moraxella catarrhalis is one the most
	important agents of human respiratory tract infections. This species
	is composed of two distinct lineages, one of only moderate virulence,
	the so-called serosensitive subpopulation, and a second, the seroresistant
	one, which is enriched among strains that harbor two major virulence
	traits: complement resistance and adherence to epithelial cells.
	Using a suite of population genetics tools, we show that the seroresistant
	lineage is also characterized by higher homologous recombination
	and mutation rates at housekeeping genes relative to its less pathogenic
	counterpart. Thus, sex and virulence have evolved in tandem in M.
	catarrhalis. Moreover, phylogenetic and Bayesian analyses that take
	into account recombination between the two clades show that the ancestral
	group was avirulent, is possibly 70 million years old, and must have
	infected mammals prior to the evolution of humans, which occurred
	later. The younger seroresistant isolates went through an important
	population expansion some 5 million years ago, coincident with the
	hominid expansion. This rise and spread was possibly coupled with
	a host shift and the acquisition of virulence genes.},
