  abstract = {We present GSR, a probabilistic model integrating gene duplication,
	sequence evolution, and a relaxed molecular clock for substitution
	rates, that enables genomewide analysis of gene families. The gene
	duplication and loss process is a major cause for incongruence between
	gene and species tree, and deterministic methods have been developed
	to explain such differences through tree reconciliations. Although
	probabilistic methods for phylogenetic inference have been around
	for decades, probabilistic reconciliation methods are far less established.
	Based on our model, we have implemented a Bayesian analysis tool,
	PrIME-GSR, for gene tree inference that takes a known species tree
	into account. Our implementation is sound and we demonstrate its
	utility for genomewide gene-family analysis by applying it to recently
	presented yeast data. We validate PrIME-GSR by comparing with previous
	analyses of these data that take advantage of gene order information.
	In a case study we apply our method to the ADH gene family and are
	able to draw biologically relevant conclusions concerning gene duplications
	creating key yeast phenotypes. On a higher level this shows the biological
	relevance of our method. The obtained results demonstrate the value
	of a relaxed molecular clock. Our good performance will extend to
	species where gene order conservation is insufficient.},

  journal = {PLoS One},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {2},
  pages = {e879},
  number = {9},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because rates of evolution and species divergence times
	cannot be estimated directly from molecular data, all current dating
	methods require that specific assumptions be made before inferring
	any divergence time. These assumptions typically bear either on rates
	of molecular evolution (molecular clock hypothesis, local clocks
	models) or on both rates and times (penalized likelihood, Bayesian
	methods). However, most of these assumptions can affect estimated
	dates, oftentimes because they underestimate large amounts of rate
	change. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A significant modification to a recently
	proposed ad hoc rate-smoothing algorithm is described, in which local
	molecular clocks are automatically placed on a phylogeny. This modification
	makes use of hybrid approaches that borrow from recent theoretical
	developments in microarray data analysis. An ad hoc integration of
	phylogenetic uncertainty under these local clock models is also described.
	The performance and accuracy of the new methods are evaluated by
	reanalyzing three published data sets. CONCLUSIONS: It is shown that
	the new maximum likelihood hybrid methods can perform better than
	penalized likelihood and almost as well as uncorrelated Bayesian
	models. However, the new methods still tend to underestimate the
	actual amount of rate change. This work demonstrates the difficulty
	of estimating divergence times using local molecular clocks.},

  abstract = {The molecular clock, i.e., constancy of the rate of evolution over
	time, is commonly assumed in estimating divergence dates. However,
	this assumption is often violated and has drastic effects on date
	estimation. Recently, a number of attempts have been made to relax
	the clock assumption. One approach is to use maximum likelihood,
	which assigns rates to branches and allows the estimation of both
	rates and times. An alternative is the Bayes approach, which models
	the change of the rate over time. A number of models of rate change
	have been proposed. We have extended and evaluated models of rate
	evolution, i.e., the lognormal and its recent variant, along with
	the gamma, the exponential, and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.
	These models were first applied to a small hominoid data set, where
	an empirical Bayes approach was used to estimate the hyperparameters
	that measure the amount of rate variation. Estimation of divergence
	times was sensitive to these hyperparameters, especially when the
	assumed model is close to the clock assumption. The rate and date
	estimates varied little from model to model, although the posterior
	Bayes factor indicated the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process outperformed
	the other models. To demonstrate the importance of allowing for rate
	change across lineages, this general approach was used to analyze
	a larger data set consisting of the 18S ribosomal RNA gene of 39
	metazoan species. We obtained date estimates consistent with paleontological
	records, the deepest split within the group being about 560 million
	years ago. Estimates of the rates were in accordance with the Cambrian
	explosion hypothesis and suggested some more recent lineage-specific
	bursts of evolution.},

  abstract = {It is frequently true that molecular sequences do not evolve in a
	strictly clocklike manner. Instead, substitution rate may vary for
	a number of reasons, including changes in selection pressure and
	effective population size, as well as changes in mean generation

	in substitution rates when serially sampled molecular sequences are
	available. These methods are based on multiple rates with dated tips
	(MRDT) models and allow different rates to be estimated for different
	intervals of time. These intervals may correspond to the sampling
	intervals or to a priori--defined intervals that are not coincident
	with the times the serial samples are obtained. Two methods for obtaining
	estimates of multiple rates are described. The first is an extension
	of the phylogeny-based maximum-likelihood estimation procedure introduced
	by Rambaut. The second is a new parameterization of the pairwise

  abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular
	clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance
	in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically
	unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these
	two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed
	molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate
	to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new
	approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe
	how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in
	the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times.
	Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness
	of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and
	phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches
	in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are
	not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these
	datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular
	clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses

	alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically

	sequences, where each pair of sequences allows a precise estimate
	of the divergence time of those two gene copies. The average divergence
	time of all pairs of copies estimates twice the effective population
	number and an estimate can also be derived from the number of segregating

	This paper shows how a maximum likelihood estimate of the effective
	population number can be derived from such a genealogical tree. The
	pairwise and the segregating sites estimates are shown to be much
	less efficient than this maximum likelihood estimate, and this is

	tested the accuracy of several relaxed-clock methods (penalized likelihood

	nucleotide sequences simulated on a nine-taxon tree. When the sequences
	evolved with a constant rate, the methods were able to infer rates

	was assumed. When the sequences evolved under a model of auto-correlated
	rate change, rates were accurately estimated using penalized likelihood

  abstract = {The molecular clock hypothesis remains an important conceptual and
	analytical tool in evolutionary biology despite the repeated observation
	that the clock hypothesis does not perfectly explain observed DNA
	sequence variation. We introduce a parametric model that relaxes
	the molecular clock by allowing rates to vary across lineages according
	to a compound Poisson process. Events of substitution rate change
	are placed onto a phylogenetic tree according to a Poisson process.
	When an event of substitution rate change occurs, the current rate
	of substitution is modified by a gamma-distributed random variable.
	Parameters of the model can be estimated using Bayesian inference.
	We use Markov chain Monte Carlo integration to evaluate the posterior
	probability distribution because the posterior probability involves
	high dimensional integrals and summations. Specifically, we use the
	Metropolis-Hastings-Green algorithm with 11 different move types
	to evaluate the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the method
	by analyzing a complete mtDNA sequence data set from 23 mammals.
	The model presented here has several potential advantages over other
	models that have been proposed to relax the clock because it is parametric
	and does not assume that rates change only at speciation events.
	This model should prove useful for estimating divergence times when
	substitution rates vary across lineages.},

	Each gene corresponds to a single locus at which there is no recombination.
	The genealogy of the sample is embedded in a graph which we call
	the ancestral selection graph. This graph contains all the information
	about the ancestry; it is the analogue of Kingman's coalescent process
	which arises in the case with no selection. The ancestral selection
	graph can be easily simulated and we outline an algorithm for simulating
	samples. The main goal is to analyze the ancestral selection graph
	and to compare it to Kingman's coalescent process. In the case of
	no mutation, we find that the distribution of the time to the most
	recent common ancestor does not depend on the selection coefficient
	and hence is the same as in the neutral case. When the mutation rate
	is positive, we give a procedure for computing the probability that
	two individuals in a sample are identical by descent and the Laplace
	transform of the time to the most recent common ancestor of a sample
	of two individuals; we evaluate the first two terms of their respective
	power series in terms of the selection coefficient. The probability
	of identity by descent depends on both the selection coefficient

	in the neutral case. The Laplace transform does not have a linear
	correction term in the selection coefficient. We also provide a recursion

	of fast likelihood-based "counting methods" that employ either a
	single most likely ancestral reconstruction, weighting across all
	possible ancestral reconstructions, or sampling from ancestral reconstructions;
	(2) a random effects likelihood (REL) approach, which models variation
	in nonsynonymous and synonymous rates across sites according to a
	predefined distribution, with the selection pressure at an individual
	site inferred using an empirical Bayes approach; and (3) a fixed
	effects likelihood (FEL) method that directly estimates nonsynonymous
	and synonymous substitution rates at each site. All three methods
	incorporate flexible models of nucleotide substitution bias and variation
	in both nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates across sites,
	facilitating the comparison between the methods. We demonstrate that
	the results obtained using these approaches show broad agreement
	in levels of Type I and Type II error and in estimates of substitution
	rates. Counting methods are well suited for large alignments, for
	which there is high power to detect positive and negative selection,

	which is more computationally intensive than counting methods, has
	higher power than counting methods to detect selection in data sets

	of rate variation better than counting methods or random effects
	models, does not suffer from as many false positives as random effects
	models for data sets comprising few sequences, and can be efficiently
	parallelized. Our results suggest that previously reported differences
	between results obtained by counting methods and random effects models
	arise due to a combination of the conservative nature of counting-based
	methods, the failure of current random effects models to allow for
	variation in synonymous substitution rates, and the naive application
	of random effects models to extremely sparse data sets. We demonstrate
	our methods on sequence data from the human immunodeficiency virus

	molecular data provides the opportunity to answer many important
	questions in evolutionary biology. However, molecular dating techniques
	have previously been criticized for failing to adequately account
	for variation in the rate of molecular evolution. We present a maximum-likelihood
	approach to estimating divergence times that deals explicitly with
	the problem of rate variation. This method has many advantages over
	previous approaches including the following: (1) a rate constancy
	test excludes data for which rate heterogeneity is detected; (2)
	date estimates are generated with confidence intervals that allow
	the explicit testing of hypotheses regarding divergence times; and
	(3) a range of sequences and fossil dates are used, removing the
	reliance on a single calculated calibration rate. We present tests
	of the accuracy of our method, which show it to be robust to the
	effects of some modes of rate variation. In addition, we test the
	effect of substitution model and length of sequence on the accuracy
	of the dating technique. We believe that the method presented here
	offers solutions to many of the problems facing molecular dating
	and provides a platform for future improvements to such analyses.},

	Uncertainties in fossil calibrations are described using flexible

	lacking fossil calibrations is specified by use of a birth-death
	process with species sampling. The prior for lineage-specific substitution
	rates is specified using either a model with autocorrelated rates
	among adjacent lineages (based on a geometric Brownian motion model
	of rate drift) or a model with independent rates among lineages specified
	by a log-normal probability distribution. We develop an infinite-sites

	infinity, the width of the posterior credibility interval and the
	posterior mean of divergence times form a perfect linear relationship,
	with the slope indicating uncertainties in time estimates that cannot
	be reduced by sequence data alone. Simulations are used to study
	the influence of among-lineage rate variation and the number of loci
	sampled on the uncertainty of divergence time estimates. The analysis
	suggests that posterior time estimates typically involve considerable
	uncertainties even with an infinite amount of sequence data, and
	that the reliability and precision of fossil calibrations are critically
	important to divergence time estimation. We apply our new algorithms

	segment of mtDNA sequences from nine primates, REV cannot provide
	a significantly better fit than HKY85 when rate variation over sites

	models that allow the omega ratio to vary either among lineages or
	among sites. In this paper we extend previous models to allow the
	omega ratio to vary both among sites and among lineages and implement
	the new models in the likelihood framework. These models may be useful
	for identifying positive selection along prespecified lineages that
	affects only a few sites in the protein. We apply those branch-site
	models as well as previous branch- and site-specific models to three
	data sets: the lysozyme genes from primates, the tumor suppressor
	BRCA1 genes from primates, and the phytochrome (PHY) gene family
	in angiosperms. Positive selection is detected in the lysozyme and
	BRCA genes by both the new and the old models. However, only the
	new models detected positive selection acting on lineages after gene
	duplication in the PHY gene family. Additional tests on several data
	sets suggest that the new models may be useful in detecting positive
	selection after gene duplication in gene family evolution.},

  abstract = {Comparison of relative fixation rates of synonymous (silent) and nonsynonymous
	(amino acid-altering) mutations provides a means for understanding
	the mechanisms of molecular sequence evolution. The nonsynonymous/synonymous
	rate ratio (omega = d(N)d(S)) is an important indicator of selective
	pressure at the protein level, with omega = 1 meaning neutral mutations,
	omega < 1 purifying selection, and omega > 1 diversifying positive
	selection. Amino acid sites in a protein are expected to be under
	different selective pressures and have different underlying omega
	ratios. We develop models that account for heterogeneous omega ratios
	among amino acid sites and apply them to phylogenetic analyses of
	protein-coding DNA sequences. These models are useful for testing
	for adaptive molecular evolution and identifying amino acid sites
	under diversifying selection. Ten data sets of genes from nuclear,
	mitochondrial, and viral genomes are analyzed to estimate the distributions
	of omega among sites. In all data sets analyzed, the selective pressure
	indicated by the omega ratio is found to be highly heterogeneous
	among sites. Previously unsuspected Darwinian selection is detected
	in several genes in which the average omega ratio across sites is
	<1, but in which some sites are clearly under diversifying selection
	with omega > 1. Genes undergoing positive selection include the beta-globin
	gene from vertebrates, mitochondrial protein-coding genes from hominoids,
	the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from human influenza virus A, and HIV-1
	env, vif, and pol genes. Tests for the presence of positively selected
	sites and their subsequent identification appear quite robust to
	the specific distributional form assumed for omega and can be achieved
	using any of several models we implement. However, we encountered
	difficulties in estimating the precise distribution of omega among
	sites from real data sets.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Heterochronous gene sequence data is important for characterizing
	the evolutionary processes of fast-evolving organisms such as RNA
	viruses. A limited set of algorithms exists for estimating the rate
	of nucleotide substitution and inferring phylogenetic trees from
	such data. The authors here present a new method, Tree and Rate Estimation
	by Local Evaluation (TREBLE) that robustly calculates the rate of
	nucleotide substitution and phylogeny with several orders of magnitude
	improvement in computational time. METHODS: For the basis of its
	rate estimation TREBLE novelly utilizes a geometric interpretation
	of the molecular clock assumption to deduce a local estimate of the
	rate of nucleotide substitution for triplets of dated sequences.
	Averaging the triplet estimates via a variance weighting yields a
	global estimate of the rate. From this value, an iterative refinement
	procedure relying on statistical properties of the triplets then
	generates a final estimate of the global rate of nucleotide substitution.
	The estimated global rate is then utilized to find the tree from
	the pairwise distance matrix via an UPGMA-like algorithm. RESULTS:
	Simulation studies show that TREBLE estimates the rate of nucleotide
	substitution with point estimates comparable with the best of available
	methods. Confidence intervals are comparable with that of BEAST.
	TREBLE's phylogenetic reconstruction is significantly improved over
	the other distance matrix method but not as accurate as the Bayesian
	algorithm. Compared with three other algorithms, TREBLE reduces computational
	time by a minimum factor of 3000. Relative to the algorithm with
	the most accurate estimates for the rate of nucleotide substitution
	(i.e. BEAST), TREBLE is over 10,000 times more computationally efficient.

  abstract = {Divergence time and substitution rate are seriously confounded in
	phylogenetic analysis, making it difficult to estimate divergence
	times when the molecular clock (rate constancy among lineages) is
	violated. This problem can be alleviated to some extent by analyzing
	multiple gene loci simultaneously and by using multiple calibration
	points. While different genes may have different patterns of evolutionary
	rate change, they share the same divergence times. Indeed, the fact
	that each gene may violate the molecular clock differently leads
	to the advantage of simultaneous analysis of multiple loci. Multiple
	calibration points provide the means for characterizing the local
	evolutionary rates on the phylogeny. In this paper, we extend previous
	likelihood models of local molecular clock for estimating species
	divergence times to accommodate multiple calibration points and multiple
	genes. Heterogeneity among different genes in evolutionary rate and
	in substitution process is accounted for by the models. We apply
	the likelihood models to analyze two mitochondrial protein-coding
	genes, cytochrome oxidase II and cytochrome b, to estimate divergence
	times of Malagasy mouse lemurs and related outgroups. The likelihood
	method is compared with the Bayes method of Thorne et al. (1998,
	Mol. Biol. Evol. 15:1647-1657), which uses a probabilistic model
	to describe the change in evolutionary rate over time and uses the
	Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure to derive the posterior distribution
	of rates and times. Our likelihood implementation has the drawbacks
	of failing to accommodate uncertainties in fossil calibrations and
	of requiring the researcher to classify branches on the tree into
	different rate groups. Both problems are avoided in the Bayes method.
	Despite the differences in the two methods, however, data partitions
	and model assumptions had the greatest impact on date estimation.
	The three codon positions have very different substitution rates
	and evolutionary dynamics, and assumptions in the substitution model
	affect date estimation in both likelihood and Bayes analyses. The
	results demonstrate that the separate analysis is unreliable, with
	dates variable among codon positions and between methods, and that
	the combined analysis is much more reliable. When the three codon
	positions were analyzed simultaneously under the most realistic models
	using all available calibration information, the two methods produced
	similar results. The divergence of the mouse lemurs is dated to be
	around 7-10 million years ago, indicating a surprisingly early species
	radiation for such a morphologically uniform group of primates.},

  abstract = {Accurately estimating the evolutionary rate and age of hepatitis B
	virus (HBV) has proven to be one of the most difficult problems in
	studies of viral evolution. To help resolve these issues we employed
	a recently developed Bayesian coalescent approach to globally sampled
	human and avian hepadnavirus genome sequences, accounting for lineage-specific
	rate variation, the presence of overlapping reading frames, and the
	potential impact of recombination. Our analysis revealed an unexpectedly
	high rate of evolutionary change--up to 10(-4) nucleotide substitutions
	(subs) per site per year and always more than approximately 10(-6)
	subs/site/year. These rates suggested a time to the most recent common
	ancestor (tMRCA) of the sampled isolates of consistently less than
	approximately 1500 years ago for human HBV and less than 6000 years
	ago for the avian hepadnaviruses. Notably, the evolutionary rate
	of nonoverlapping regions of the viral genome was approximately 2-fold
	greater than that of overlapping genome regions, reflecting the complex
	patterns of selective constraint inherent in the former. We also
	reveal that most recombination events in both human and avian HBV
	tend to fall in a specific region of the viral genome, which contains
	all four viral open reading frames and which may therefore represent
	a "hot spot" for recombination. However, while recombination affects
	estimates of both evolutionary rate and tMRCA, in no case was this
	sufficient to challenge the hypothesis that the dominant mode of
	HBV evolution is by recent cross-species transmission. We conclude
	that HBV exhibits rapid evolutionary dynamics, typical of other viruses
	dependent on reverse transcriptase-mediated replication.},
