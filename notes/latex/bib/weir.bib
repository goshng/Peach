  abstract = {{When DNA evidence is used to implicate a suspect, it may be of interest
	to know whether it is likely that the suspect's near relatives also
	share the suspect's DNA profile. In this study we discuss methods
	for evaluating the probability that at least one of a set of the
	suspect's full or half-siblings shares the suspect's DNA profile.
	We present three such methods: exact calculation, estimation via
	Monte Carlo simulations, and estimation by means of sandwiching the
	probability between an upper and a lower bound. We show that, under
	many circumstances, this upper bound itself provides an extremely
	quick and accurate estimate of the probability that at least one
	of the relatives matches the suspect's profile.}},

	A maximum-likelihood estimator that includes as a parameter is introduced

	been obtained if the subpopulations allele frequencies had been known.
	This F-ST is misspecified. Bootstrap confidence estimator is shown

  abstract = {{We present theory clarifying the general behavior of F(ST)-based
	and G(ST)-based estimators of gene flow, and confirm these predictions
	with simulations. In particular, we use the correlation of genes
	within groups within populations to define an estimator. The theoretical
	value of the correlation doe not depend on the number of groups in
	a population, and properties of the estimated correlation do not
	depend on the number of groups sampled or the number of individuals
	sampled per group. This invariance is in contrast to properties of
	G(ST). For a complete census of a population, bias and variance considerations
	would suggest the use of the G(ST)-based estimator of gene flow,
	but lack of knowledge of population size or group number in practice
	suggests preference be given to the correlation-based estimator.
	We acknowledge that these estimators require that several conditions
	of a population-genetic model be met, since they do not make use
	of direct observations on the flow of genes. Our results differ from
	some of those based on simulation in a series of recent papers by
	M. Slatkin.}},

	Is an estimate necessary and how should it be made? The authors find
	that all modern methods have areas of strength and weakness. The
	assessment of which is the `best' is subjective and depends on the
	performance of the method, the type of problem (criminal work or
	paternity), the database size and availability of computing software
	and support. The authors preferred the highest posterior density
	approach for performance, however the other methods all have areas
	where their performance is adequate. For single-contributor stains
	normal approximation methods are suitable, also the bootstrap and
	the highest posterior density method. For multiple-contributor stains
	or other complex situations the match probability expressions become
	quite complex and it may not be possible to derive the necessary
	variance expressions. The highest posterior density or the bootstrap
	provide a better general method, with non-zero theta. The size-bias
	correction and the factor of 10 approaches may be considered acceptable
	by many forensic scientists as long as their limitations are understood.}},

	as applied to the use of molecular marker technology and quantitative
	genetics in the search for genes affecting quantitative traits responsible
	for specific diseases and economically important agronomic traits.
	Since an exhaustive literature review is not possible, the limited
	scope of this work is to encourage further statistical work in this
	vast field by first reviewing human and domestic species literature,
	and then concentrating on the statistical developments for experimental
	breeding populations. Substantial gains have been made over the years
	by both plant and animal breeders toward a long-term goal of locating
	genes affecting quantitative traits (quantitative trait loci, QTLs)
	for the eventual characterization and manipulation of these genes
	in order to develop improved agronomically important traits. Our
	main concern is that the care and expense that are required in generating
	both genetic marker data and quantitative trait data should be accompanied
	by equal care in the statistical analysis of the data. Through an
	example using an F-2 male genetic map of mouse chromosome 10, and
	quantitative trait values measured on weight gain, we implement much
	of the reviewed methodology for the purpose of detecting or locating
	a QTL having an effect on weight gain.}},

	Basic assumptions are that there is random mating, Hardy-Weinberg

	and equally distant populations. It is based on the variances between
	and within populations of genotype frequencies, whereas previously
	moment methods for dominant markers have been indirect in that they
	have been based on first estimating allele frequencies and then using
	the variances of those frequencies. The use of genotype frequencies
	directly appears to be more robust. Approximate sampling errors of

  abstract = {It is well established that test statistics and P-values derived from
	discrete data, such as genetic markers, are also discrete. In most
	genetic applications, the null distribution for a discrete test statistic
	is approximated with a continuous distribution, but this approximation
	may not be reasonable. In some cases using the continuous approximation
	for the expected null distribution may cause truly null test statistics
	to appear nonnull. We explore the implications of using continuous
	distributions to approximate the discrete distributions of Hardy-Weinberg
	equilibrium test statistics and P-values. We derive exact P-value
	distributions under the null and alternative hypotheses, enabling
	a more accurate analysis than is possible with continuous approximations.
	We apply these methods to biological data and find that using continuous
	distribution theory with exact tests may underestimate the extent
	of Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium in a sample. The implications may
	be most important for the widespread use of whole-genome case-control
	association studies and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) testing
	for data quality control.},

  abstract = {The coancestry coefficient, also known as the population structure
	parameter, is of great interest in population genetics. It can be
	thought of as the intraclass correlation of pairs of alleles within
	populations and it can serve as a measure of genetic distance between
	populations. For a general class of evolutionary models it determines
	the distribution of allele frequencies among populations. Under more
	restrictive models it can be regarded as the probability of identity
	by descent of any pair of alleles at a locus within a random mating
	population. In this paper we review estimation procedures that use
	the method of moments or are maximum likelihood under the assumption
	of normally distributed allele frequencies. We then consider the
	problem of testing hypotheses about this parameter. In addition to
	parametric and non-parametric bootstrap tests we present an asymptotically-distributed
	chi-square test. This test reduces to the contingency-table test
	for equal sample sizes across populations. Our new test appears to
	be more powerful than previous tests, especially for loci with multiple
	alleles. We apply our methods to HapMap SNP data to confirm that
	the coancestry coefficient for humans is strictly positive.},

	markers, we evaluated procedures for estimating allele frequencies
	by pooling DNA from multiple individuals, a method suggested as cost-effective
	relative to individual genotyping. Using moment-based estimators,
	we estimated allele frequencies in experimental DNA pools and found
	that the three primary laboratory steps, DNA quantitation and pooling,
	PCR amplification, and electrophoresis, accounted for 23, 48, and
	29\%, respectively, of the technical variance of estimates in pools
	containing DNA from 2-24 individuals. Exact allele-frequency estimates
	could be made for pools of sizes 2-8, depending on the locus, by
	using an integer-valued estimator. Larger pools of size 12 and 24
	tended to yield biased estimates; however, replicates of these estimates
	detected allele frequency differences among pools with different
	allelic compositions. We also derive an unbiased estimator of Hardy-Weinberg
	disequilibrium coefficients that uses multiple DNA pools and analyze
	the cost-efficiency of DNA pooling. DNA pooling yields the most potential
	cost savings when a large number of loci are employed using a large
	number of individuals, a situation becoming increasingly common as
	microsatellite loci are developed in increasing numbers of taxa.}},

  abstract = {The correlation between alleles at a pair of genetic loci is a measure
	of linkage disequilibrium. The square of the sample correlation multiplied
	by sample size provides the usual test statistic for the hypothesis
	of no disequilibrium for loci with two alleles and this relation
	has proved useful for study design and marker selection. Nevertheless,
	this relation holds only in a diallelic case, and an extension to
	multiple alleles has not been made. Here we introduce a similar statistic,
	R2, which leads to a correlation-based test for loci with multiple
	alleles: for a pair of loci with k and m alleles, and a sample of
	n individuals, the approximate distribution of n(k - 1)(m - 1)/(km)R2
	under independence between loci is chi2(k-1(m-1). One advantage of
	this statistic is that it can be interpreted as the total correlation
	between a pair of loci. When the phase of two-locus genotypes is
	known, the approach is equivalent to a test for the overall correlation
	between rows and columns in a contingency table. In the phase-known
	case, R2 is the sum of the squared sample correlations for all km
	2 x 2 subtables formed by collapsing to one allele vs. the rest at
	each locus. We examine the approximate distribution under the null
	of independence for R2 and report its close agreement with the exact
	distribution obtained by permutation. The test for independence using
	R2 is a strong competitor to approaches such as Pearson's chi square,
	Fisher's exact test, and a test based on Cressie and Read's power
	divergence statistic. We combine this approach with our previous
	composite-disequilibrium measures to address the case when the genotypic
	phase is unknown. Calculation of the new multiallele test statistic
	and its P-value is very simple and utilizes the approximate distribution
	of R2. We provide a computer program that evaluates approximate as
	well as "exact" permutational P-values.},

	were conducted to compare efficiencies of estimation by minimum norm
	quadratic unbiased estimation (MINQUE) and restricted maximum likelihood

	a similar efficiency to MINQUE(theta), which requires prior estimates

	estimation and convenient computation. An adjusted unbiased prediction
	(AUP) method is developed for predicting random genetic effects.
	AUP is desirable for its easy computation and unbiasedness of both
	mean and variance of predictors. The jackknife procedure is appropriate
	for estimating the sampling variances of estimated variances (or
	covariances) and of predicted genetic effects. A t-test based on
	jackknife variances is applicable for detecting significance of variation.

  abstract = {{A MINQUE(1) procedure, which is minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation
	(MINQUE) method with 1 for all the prior values, is suggested for
	estimating variance and covariance components in a bio-model for
	diallel crosses. Unbiasedness and efficiency of estimation were compared
	for MINQUE(1), restricted maximum likelihood (REML) and MINQUE(theta)
	which has parameter values for the prior values. MINQUE(1) is almost
	as efficient as MINQUE(theta) for unbiased estimation of genetic
	variance and covariance components. The bio-model is efficient and
	robust for estimating variance and covariance components for maternal
	and paternal effects as well as for nuclear effects. A procedure
	of adjusted unbiased prediction (AUP) is proposed for predicting
	random genetic effects in the bio-model. The jack-knife procedure
	is suggested for estimation of sampling variances of estimated variance
	and covariance components and of predicted genetic effects. Worked
	examples are given for estimation of variance and covariance components
	and for prediction of genetic merits.}},

  abstract = {{Genetic models for quantitative traits of triploid endosperms are
	proposed for the analysis of direct gene effects, cytoplasmic effects,

	maternal additive and dominance components. In the full genetic model,
	the direct effect is partitioned into direct additive and dominance
	components and high-order dominance component, which are the cumulative
	effects of three-allele interactions. If the high-order dominance
	effects are of no importance, a reduced genetic model can be used.
	Monte Carlo simulations were conducted in this study for demonstrating
	unbiasedness of estimated variance and covariance components from

	estimation (MINQUE) method setting 0 for all the prior covariances

	Both full and reduced genetic models are shown to be robust for estimating
	variance and covariance components under several situations of no
