	In a population of constant size, and with no selection, the probability
	of survival of some part of a stretch of map length y<1 approaches
	y/log(yt/2) for log(yt)much greater than1. Thus, the whole genome
	is certain to be lost, but the rate of loss is extremely slow. This
	solution extends to give the whole distribution of surviving block
	sizes as a function of time. We show that the expected number of
	blocks at time t is 1+yt and give expressions for the moments of
	the number of blocks and the total amount of genome that survives
	for a given time. The solution is based on a branching process and
	assumes complete interference between crossovers, so that each descendant
	carries only a single block of ancestral material. We consider cases
	where most individuals carry multiple blocks, either because there
	are multiple crossovers in a long genetic map, or because enowilt
	time has passed that most individuals in the population are related
	to each other. For species such as ours, which have a long genetic
	map, the genome of any individual which leaves descendants (similar
	to80\% of the population for a Poisson offspring number with mean
	two) is likely to persist for an extremely long time, in the form
	of a few short blocks of genome. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights

	robust, but selection changes the rate of coalescence (the time between
	branching events). The change in the rate of coalescence is not uniform,
	rather the reduction in the time between branching events is greatest
	when the coalescent is small (immediately after the common ancestor
	is the only member of the coalescent) with little change when the
	coalescent is large (immediately preceding when that common ancestor
	becomes fixed and the size of the coalescent is N). This provides
	that the reduction in the coalescent time due to selection is much
	greater than the reduction in the cumulative size of the coalescent
	(total number of ancestors of the present population after and including
	the most recent common ancestor) due to selection. If Ns >> 1, the
	coalescent and fixation times are approximately equal to ln 2Ns/s,
	which is much less than the value N which would result from neutral
	drift (N rather than the canonical haploid neutral fixation time
	2N is the appropriate comparison for the model considered here),
	in particular, it is 70\% less for Ns=10 and 95\% less for Ns=100.
	However, for those values of Ns, and N ranging between 10(3) and

  abstract = {{Background: There are several situations in population biology research
	where simulating DNA sequences is useful. Simulation of biological
	populations under different evolutionary genetic models can be undertaken
	using backward or forward strategies. Backward simulations, also
	called coalescent-based simulations, are computationally efficient.
	The reason is that they are based on the history of lineages with
	surviving offspring in the current population. On the contrary, forward
	simulations are less efficient because the entire population is simulated
	from past to present. However, the coalescent framework imposes some
	limitations that forward simulation does not. Hence, there is an
	increasing interest in forward population genetic simulation and
	efficient new tools have been developed recently. Software tools
	that allow efficient simulation of large DNA fragments under complex
	evolutionary models will be very helpful when trying to better understand
	the trace left on the DNA by the different interacting evolutionary
	forces. Here I will introduce GenomePop, a forward simulation program
	that fulfills the above requirements. The use of the program is demonstrated
	by studying the impact of intracodon recombination on global and
	site-specific dN/dS estimation. Results: I have developed algorithms
	and written software to efficiently simulate, forward in time, different
	Markovian nucleotide or codon models of DNA mutation. Such models
	can be combined with recombination, at inter and intra codon levels,
	fitness-based selection and complex demographic scenarios. Conclusion:
	GenomePop has many interesting characteristics for simulating SNPs
	or DNA sequences under complex evolutionary and demographic models.
	These features make it unique with respect to other simulation tools.
	Namely, the possibility of forward simulation under General Time
	Reversible (GTR) mutation or GTR x MG94 codon models with intra-codon
	recombination, arbitrary, user-defined, migration patterns, diploid
	or haploid models, constant or variable population sizes, etc. It
	also allows simulation of fitness-based selection under different
	distributions of mutational effects. Under the 2-allele model it
	allows the simulation of recombination hot-spots, the definition
	of different frequencies in different populations, etc. GenomePop
	can also manage large DNA fragments. In addition, it has a scaling
	option to save computation time when simulating large sequences and
	population sizes under complex demographic and evolutionary situations.

	part of the history of a sample from a population structured by restricted
	migration among subpopulations, or demes. The result holds in the
	limit as the number of demes tends to infinity with proportionately
	weak selection, and we have also made the assumptions of island-type
	migration and that demes are equivalent in size. After an instantaneous
	sample-size adjustment, this structured ancestral selection graph
	converges to an unstructured ancestral selection graph with a mutation
	parameter that depends inversely on the migration rate. In contrast,
	the selection parameter for the population is independent of the
	migration rate and is identical to the selection parameter in an
	unstructured population. We show analytically that estimators of
	the migration rate, based on pairwise sequence differences, derived
	under the assumption of neutrality should perform equally well in
	the presence of weak selection. We also modify an algorithm for simulating
	genealogies conditional on the frequencies of two selected alleles

	gene genealogies under the many-demes ancestral selection graph and

  abstract = {{In this report, we investigate the statistical power of several tests
	of selective neutrality based on patterns of genetic diversity within
	and between species. The goal is to compare tests based solely on
	population genetic data with tests using comparative data or a combination
	of comparative and population genetic data. We show that in the presence
	of repeated selective sweeps on relatively neutral background, tests
	based on the d(N)/d(S) ratios in comparative data almost always have
	more power to detect selection than tests based on population genetic
	data, even if the overall level of divergence is low. Tests based
	solely on the distribution of allele frequencies or the site frequency
	spectrum, such as the Ewens-Watterson test or Tajima's D, have less
	power in detecting both positive and negative selection because of
	the transient nature of positive selection and the weak signal left
	by negative selection. The Hudson-Kreitman-Aguade test is the most
	powerful test for detecting positive selection among the population
	genetic tests investigated, whereas McDonald-Kreitman test typically
	has more power to detect negative selection. We discuss our findings
	in the light of the discordant results obtained in several recently
	published genomic scans.}},

  abstract = {{We present a novel composite-likelihood-ratio test (CLRT) for detecting
	genes and genomic regions that are subject to recurrent natural selection
	(either positive or negative). The method uses the likelihood functions
	of H-ARTL, et al. (1994) for inference in a Wright-Fishcr genic selection
	model and corrects for nonindependence among sites by application
	of coalescent simulations with recombination. Here, we (1) characterize
	the distribution of the CLRT statistic (A) as a function of the population
	recombination rate (R = 4N(e)r); (2) explore the effects of bias
	in estimation of R on the size (type I error) of the CLRT; (3) explore
	the robustness of the model to population growth, bottlenecks, and
	migration; (4) explore the power of the CLRT under varying levels
	of mutation, selection, and recombination; (5) explore the discriminatory
	power of the test in distinguishing negative selection from population
	growth; and (6) evaluate the performance of maximum composite-likelihood
	estimation (MCLE) of the selection coefficient. We find that the
	test has excellent power to detect weak negative selection and moderate
	power to detect positive selection. Moreover, the test is quite robust
	to bias in the estimate of local recombination rate, but not to certain
	demographic scenarios such as population growth or a recent bottleneck.
	Last, we demonstrate that the MCLE of the selection parameter has
	little bias for weak negative selection and has downward bias for
	positively selected mutations.}},
