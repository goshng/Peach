  title = {Optimal amnesic probabilistic automata or how to learn and classify

  abstract = {Statistical modeling of sequences is a central paradigm of machine
	learning that finds multiple uses in computational molecular biology
	and many other domains. The probabilistic automata typically built
	in these contexts are subtended by uniform, fixed-memory Markov models.
	In practice, such automata tend to be unnecessarily bulky and computationally
	imposing both during their synthesis and use. Recently, D. Ron, Y.
	Singer, and N. Tishby built much more compact, tree-shaped variants
	of probabilistic automata under the assumption of an underlying Markov
	process of variable memory length. These variants, called Probabilistic
	Suffix Trees (PSTs) were subsequently adapted by G. Bejerano and
	G. Yona and applied successfully to learning and prediction of protein
	families. The process of learning the automaton from a given training
	set S of sequences requires theta(Ln2) worst-case time, where n is
	the total length of the sequences in S and L is the length of a longest
	substring of S to be considered for a candidate state in the automaton.
	Once the automaton is built, predicting the likelihood of a query
	sequence of m characters may cost time theta(m2) in the worst case.
	The main contribution of this paper is to introduce automata equivalent
	to PSTs but having the following properties: Learning the automaton,
	for any L, takes O (n) time. Prediction of a string of m symbols
	by the automaton takes O (m) time. Along the way, the paper presents
	an evolving learning scheme and addresses notions of empirical probability
	and related efficient computation, which is a by-product possibly
	of more general interest.},

  abstract = {We present a general purpose implementation of variable length Markov
	models. Contrary to fixed order Markov models, these models are not
	restricted to a predefined uniform depth. Rather, by examining the
	training data, a model is constructed that fits higher order Markov
	dependencies where such contexts exist, while using lower order Markov
	dependencies elsewhere. As both theoretical and experimental results
	show, these models are capable of capturing rich signals from a modest
	amount of training data, without the use of hidden states. AVAILABILITY:

  title = {Identification of transcription factor binding sites with variable-order

  journal = {Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {21},
  pages = {2657--2666},
  number = {11},
  month = {Jun},
  abstract = {MOTIVATION: We propose a new class of variable-order Bayesian network
	(VOBN) models for the identification of transcription factor binding
	sites (TFBSs). The proposed models generalize the widely used position
	weight matrix (PWM) models, Markov models and Bayesian network models.
	In contrast to these models, where for each position a fixed subset
	of the remaining positions is used to model dependencies, in VOBN
	models, these subsets may vary based on the specific nucleotides
	observed, which are called the context. This flexibility turns out
	to be of advantage for the classification and analysis of TFBSs,
	as statistical dependencies between nucleotides in different TFBS
	positions (not necessarily adjacent) may be taken into account efficiently--in
	a position-specific and context-specific manner. RESULTS: We apply
	the VOBN model to a set of 238 experimentally verified sigma-70 binding
	sites in Escherichia coli. We find that the VOBN model can distinguish
	these 238 sites from a set of 472 intergenic 'non-promoter' sequences
	with a higher accuracy than fixed-order Markov models or Bayesian
	trees. We use a replicated stratified-holdout experiment having a
	fixed true-negative rate of 99.9\%. We find that for a foreground
	inhomogeneous VOBN model of order 1 and a background homogeneous
	variable-order Markov (VOM) model of order 5, the obtained mean true-positive
	(TP) rate is 47.56\%. In comparison, the best TP rate for the conventional
	models is 44.39\%, obtained from a foreground PWM model and a background
	2nd-order Markov model. As the standard deviation of the estimated
	TP rate is approximately 0.01\%, this improvement is highly significant.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Analyses of genomic signatures are gaining attention as
	they allow studies of species-specific relationships without involving
	alignments of homologous sequences. A naïve Bayesian classifier was
	built to discriminate between different bacterial compositions of
	short oligomers, also known as DNA words. The classifier has proven
	successful in identifying foreign genes in Neisseria meningitis.
	In this study we extend the classifier approach using either a fixed
	higher order Markov model (Mk) or a variable length Markov model
	(VLMk). RESULTS: We propose a simple algorithm to lock a variable
	length Markov model to a certain number of parameters and show that
	the use of Markov models greatly increases the flexibility and accuracy
	in prediction to that of a naïve model. We also test the integrity
	of classifiers in terms of false-negatives and give estimates of
	the minimal sizes of training data. We end the report by proposing
	a method to reject a false hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer.
