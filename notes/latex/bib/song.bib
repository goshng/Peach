  abstract = {We present an efficient algorithm for statistical multiple alignment
	based on the TKF91 model of Thorne, Kishino, and Felsenstein (1991)
	on an arbitrary k-leaved phylogenetic tree. The existing algorithms
	use a hidden Markov model approach, which requires at least O( radical
	5(k)) states and leads to a time complexity of O(5(k)L(k)), where
	L is the geometric mean sequence length. Using a combinatorial technique
	reminiscent of inclusion/exclusion, we are able to sum away the states,
	thus improving the time complexity to O(2(k)L(k)) and considerably
	reducing memory requirements. This makes statistical multiple alignment
	under the TKF91 model a definite practical possibility in the case
	of a phylogenetic tree with a modest number of leaves.},

  title = {A simple method for finding explicit analytic transition densities

  abstract = {The transition density function of the Wright-Fisher diffusion describes
	the evolution of population-wide allele frequencies over time. This
	function has important practical applications in population genetics,
	but finding an explicit formula under a general diploid selection
	model has remained a difficult open problem. In this article, we
	develop a new computational method to tackle this classic problem.
	Specifically, our method explicitly finds the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
	of the diffusion generator associated with the Wright-Fisher diffusion
	with recurrent mutation and arbitrary diploid selection, thus allowing
	one to obtain an accurate spectral representation of the transition
	density function. Simplicity is one of the appealing features of
	our approach. Although our derivation involves somewhat advanced
	mathematical concepts, the resulting algorithm is quite simple and
	efficient, only involving standard linear algebra. Furthermore, unlike
	previous approaches based on perturbation, which is applicable only
	when the population-scaled selection coefficient is small, our method
	is nonperturbative and is valid for a broad range of parameter values.
	As a by-product of our work, we obtain the rate of convergence to
	the stationary distribution under mutation-selection balance.},
