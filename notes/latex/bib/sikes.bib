  abstract = {Burying beetles (Silphidae: Nicrophorus) are well-known for their
	biparental care and monopolization of small vertebrate carcasses
	in subterranean crypts. They have been the focus of intense behavioral
	ecological research since the 1980s yet no thorough phylogenetic
	estimate for the group exists. The relationships among the species,
	and the validity of some species, are poorly understood. Here, we
	infer the relationships and examine species boundaries among 50 individuals
	representing 15 species, primarily of the investigator species group,
	using a mixture-model Bayesian analysis. Two mitochondrial genes,
	COI and COII, were used, providing 2129 aligned nucleotides (567
	parsimony-informative). The Akaike Information Criterion and Bayes
	Factors were used to select the best fitting model, in addition to
	Reversible Jump MCMC, which accommodated model uncertainty. A 21
	parameter, three-partition GTR+G was the final model chosen. Despite
	a presumed Old World origin for the genus itself, the basal lineages
	and immediate outgroups of the investigator species group are New
	World species. Bayesian methods reconstruct the common ancestor of
	the investigator species group as New World and imply one later transition
	to the Old World with two return transitions to the New World. Prior
	hypotheses concerning the questionable validity of four species names,
	Nicrophorus praedator, Nicrophorus confusus, Nicrophorus encaustus
	and Nicrophorus mexicanus were tested. No evidence was found for
	the validity of the Nicrophorus investigator synonym N. praedator.
	We found evidence rejecting the species status of N. confusus (NEW
	SYNONYM of Nicrophorus sepultor). Weak evidence was found for the
	species status of N. encaustus and N. mexicanus, which are tentatively
	retained as valid. Our results strongly reject a recently published
	hypothesis that Nicrophorus interruptus (NEW STATUS as valid species)
	is a subspecies of N. investigator.},
