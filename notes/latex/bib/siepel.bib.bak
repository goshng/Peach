  title = {Detecting lateral gene transfers by statistical reconciliation of

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To understand the evolutionary role of Lateral Gene Transfer
	(LGT), accurate methods are needed to identify transferred genes
	and infer their timing of acquisition. Phylogenetic methods are particularly
	promising for this purpose, but the reconciliation of a gene tree
	with a reference (species) tree is computationally hard. In addition,
	the application of these methods to real data raises the problem
	of sorting out real and artifactual phylogenetic conflict. RESULTS:
	We present Prunier, a new method for phylogenetic detection of LGT
	based on the search for a maximum statistical agreement forest (MSAF)
	between a gene tree and a reference tree. The program is flexible
	as it can use any definition of "agreement" among trees. We evaluate
	the performance of Prunier and two other programs (EEEP and RIATA-HGT)
	for their ability to detect transferred genes in realistic simulations
	where gene trees are reconstructed from sequences. Prunier proposes
	a single scenario that compares to the other methods in terms of
	sensitivity, but shows higher specificity. We show that LGT scenarios
	carry a strong signal about the position of the root of the species
	tree and could be used to identify the direction of evolutionary
	time on the species tree. We use Prunier on a biological dataset
	of 23 universal proteins and discuss their suitability for inferring
	the tree of life. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of Prunier to take into
	account branch support in the process of reconciliation allows a
	gain in complexity, in comparison to EEEP, and in accuracy in comparison
	to RIATA-HGT. Prunier's greedy algorithm proposes a single scenario
	of LGT for a gene family, but its quality always compares to the
	best solutions provided by the other algorithms. When the root position
	is uncertain in the species tree, Prunier is able to infer a scenario
	per root at a limited additional computational cost and can easily
	run on large datasets.Prunier is implemented in C++, using the Bio++
	library and the phylogeny program Treefinder. It is available at:

	the role of EII(Glc) and EIIAB(Man) in sugar metabolism, gene regulation,

	inactivation of ptsG, encoding a putative EII(Glc), did not lead
	to major changes in sugar metabolism or affect the phenotypes of
	interest. However, the loss of EII(Glc) was shown to have a significant
	impact on the proteome and to affect the expression of a known virulence
	factor, fructan hydrolase (fruA). JAM1, a mutant strain lacking EIIAB(Man),
	had an impaired capacity to form biofilms in the presence of glucose
	and displayed a decreased ability to be transformed with exogenous
	DNA. Also, the lactose- and cellobiose-PTSs were positively and negatively
	regulated by EIIAB(Man), respectively. Microarrays were used to investigate
	the profound phenotypic changes displayed by JAM1, revealing that
	EIIAB(Man) of S. mutans has a key regulatory role in energy metabolism,
	possibly by sensing the energy levels of the cells or the carbohydrate
	availability and, in response, regulating the activity of transcription
	factors and carbohydrate transporters.},

  abstract = {The phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) is the
	major sugar uptake system in oral streptococci. The role of EIIAB(Man)
	(encoded by manL) in gene regulation and sugar transport was investigated
	in Streptococcus mutans UA159. The manL knockout strain, JAM1, grew
	more slowly than the wild-type strain in glucose but grew faster
	in mannose and did not display diauxic growth, indicating that EIIAB(Man)
	is involved in sugar uptake and in carbohydrate catabolite repression.
	PTS assays of JAM1, and of strains lacking the inducible (fruI) and
	constitutive (fruCD) EII fructose, revealed that S. mutans EIIAB(Man)
	transported mannose and glucose and provided evidence that there
	was also a mannose-inducible or glucose-repressible mannose PTS.
	Additionally, there appears to be a fructose PTS that is different
	than FruI and FruCD. To determine whether EIIAB(Man) controlled expression
	of the known virulence genes, glucosyltransferases (gtfBC) and fructosyltransferase
	(ftf) promoter fusions of these genes were established in the wild-type
	and EIIAB(Man)-deficient strains. In the manL mutant, the level of
	chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity expressed from the gtfBC
	promoter was up to threefold lower than that seen with the wild-type
	strain at pH 6 and 7, indicating that EIIAB(Man) is required for
	optimal expression of gtfBC. No significant differences were observed
	between the mutant and the wild-type background in ftf regulation,
	with the exception that under glucose-limiting conditions at pH 7,
	the mutant exhibited a 2.1-fold increase in ftf expression. Two-dimensional
	gel analysis of batch-grown cells of the EIIAB(Man)-deficient strain
	indicated that the expression of at least 38 proteins was altered
	compared to that seen with the wild-type strain, revealing that EIIAB(Man)

	It can be divided into four different serotypes (c, e, f, and k),

	In this study, we demonstrate that in addition to OMZ175 and B14,
	three other strains (NCTC11060, LM7, and OM50E) of the less prevalent
	serotypes e and f are able to invade primary human coronary artery
	endothelial cells (HCAEC). Invasive strains were also significantly
	more virulent than noninvasive strains in the Galleria mellonella
	(greater wax worm) model of systemic disease. Interestingly, the
	invasive strains carried an additional gene, cnm, which was previously
	shown to bind to collagen and laminin in vitro. Inactivation of cnm
	rendered the organisms unable to invade HCAEC and attenuated their
	virulence in G. mellonella. Notably, the cnm knockout strains did
	not adhere to HCAEC as efficiently as the parental strains did, indicating
	that the loss of the invasion phenotype observed for the mutants
	was linked to an adhesion defect. Comparisons of the invasive strains
	and their respective cnm mutants did not support a correlation between
	biofilm formation and invasion. Thus, Cnm is required for S. mutans
	invasion of endothelial cells and possibly represents an important
	virulence factor of S. mutans that may contribute to cardiovascular
	infections and pathologies.},

  abstract = {CcpA globally regulates transcription in response to carbohydrate
	availability in many gram-positive bacteria, but its role in Streptococcus
	mutans remains enigmatic. Using the fructan hydrolase (fruA) gene
	of S. mutans as a model, we demonstrated that CcpA plays a direct
	role in carbon catabolite repression (CCR). Subsequently, the expression
	of 170 genes was shown to be differently expressed (> or = 2-fold)
	in glucose-grown wild-type (UA159) and CcpA-deficient (TW1) strains
	(P < or = 0.001). However, there were differences in expression of
	only 96 genes between UA159 and TW1 when cells were cultivated with
	the poorly repressing substrate galactose. Interestingly, 90 genes
	were expressed differently in wild-type S. mutans when glucose- and
	galactose-grown cells were compared, but the expression of 515 genes
	was altered in the CcpA-deficient strain in a similar comparison.
	Overall, our results supported the hypothesis that CcpA has a major
	role in CCR and regulation of gene expression but revealed that in
	S. mutans there is a substantial CcpA-independent network that regulates
	gene expression in response to the carbohydrate source. Based on
	the genetic studies, biochemical and physiological experiments demonstrated
	that loss of CcpA impacts the ability of S. mutans to transport and
	grow on selected sugars. Also, the CcpA-deficient strain displayed
	an enhanced capacity to produce acid from intracellular stores of
	polysaccharides, could grow faster at pH 5.5, and could acidify the
	environment more rapidly and to a greater extent than the parental
	strain. Thus, CcpA directly modulates the pathogenic potential of
	S. mutans through global control of gene expression.},

	recently developed method for identifying IBD sharing among individuals
	from genome-wide data to scan populations from the new HapMap phase
	3 project for regions with excess IBD sharing in order to identify
	regions in the human genome that have been under strong, very recent
	selection. The HLA region is by far the region showing the most extreme
	signal, suggesting that much of the strong recent selection acting
	on the human genome has been immune related and acting on HLA loci.

	that this type of selection cannot explain our observations.},

  abstract = {Comparative-based gene recognition is driven by the principle that
	conserved regions between related organisms are more likely than
	divergent regions to be coding. We describe a probabilistic framework
	for gene structure and alignment that can be used to simultaneously
	find both the gene structure and alignment of two syntenic genomic
	regions. A key feature of the method is the ability to enhance gene
	predictions by finding the best alignment between two syntenic sequences,
	while at the same time finding biologically meaningful alignments
	that preserve the correspondence between coding exons. Our probabilistic
	framework is the generalized pair hidden Markov model, a hybrid of
	(1). generalized hidden Markov models, which have been used previously
	for gene finding, and (2). pair hidden Markov models, which have
	applications to sequence alignment. We have built a gene finding
	and alignment program called SLAM, which aligns and identifies complete
	exon/intron structures of genes in two related but unannotated sequences
	of DNA. SLAM is able to reliably predict gene structures for any
	suitably related pair of organisms, most notably with fewer false-positive
	predictions compared to previous methods (examples are provided for
	Homo sapiens/Mus musculus and Plasmodium falciparum/Plasmodium vivax
	comparisons). Accuracy is obtained by distinguishing conserved noncoding
	sequence (CNS) from conserved coding sequence. CNS annotation is
	a novel feature of SLAM and may be useful for the annotation of UTRs,

  abstract = {In phylogenetic reconstruction, two types of bacterial tyrosyl-tRNA
	synthetases (TyrRS) form distinct clades with many bacterial phyla
	represented in both clades. Very few taxa possess both forms, and
	maximum likelihood analysis of the distribution of TyrRS types suggests
	horizontal gene transfer (HGT), rather than an ancient duplication
	followed by differential gene loss, as the contributor to the evolutionary
	history of TyrRS in bacteria. However, for each TyrRS type, phylogenetic
	reconstruction yields phylogenies similar to the ribosomal phylogeny,
	revealing that frequent gene transfer has not destroyed the expected
	phylogeny; rather, the expected phylogenetic signal was reinforced
	or even created by HGT. We show that biased HGT can mimic patterns
	created through shared ancestry by in silico simulation. Furthermore,
	in cases where genomic synteny is sufficient to allow comparisons
	of relative gene positions, both tyrRS types occupy equivalent positions
	in closely related genomes, rejecting the loss hypothesis. Although
	the two types of bacterial TyrRS are only distantly related and only
	rarely coexist in a single genome, they have many features in common
	with alleles that are swapped between related lineages. We propose
	to label these functionally similar homologs as homeoalleles. We
	conclude that the observed phylogenetic pattern reflects both vertical
	inheritance and biased HGT and that the signal caused by common organismal
	descent is difficult to distinguish from the signal due to biased
	gene transfer.},

	translated into protein sequence, and little is known about its functional
	significance. Here I show that several classes of non-coding DNA

	polymorphism when compared with synonymous sites. The former is a
	hallmark of selective constraint, but the latter is a signature of
	adaptive evolution, resembling general patterns of protein evolution
	in Drosophila. I estimate that about 40-70\% of nucleotides in intergenic
	regions, untranslated portions of mature mRNAs (UTRs) and most intronic
	DNA are evolutionarily constrained relative to synonymous sites.
	However, I also use an extension to the McDonald-Kreitman test to
	show that a substantial fraction of the nucleotide divergence in
	these regions was driven to fixation by positive selection (about
	20\% for most intronic and intergenic DNA, and 60\% for UTRs). On
	the basis of these observations, I suggest that a large fraction

	to both purifying selection and adaptive evolution. These results

  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {154},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In comparative analyses of bacterial pathogens, it has
	been common practice to discriminate between two types of genes:
	(i) those shared by pathogens and their non-pathogenic relatives
	(core genes), and (ii) those found exclusively in pathogens (pathogen-specific
	accessory genes). Rather than attempting to a priori delineate genes
	into sets more or less relevant to pathogenicity, we took a broad
	approach to the analysis of Streptococcus species by investigating
	the strength of natural selection in all clusters of homologous genes.
	The genus Streptococcus is comprised of a wide variety of both pathogenic
	and commensal lineages, and we relate our findings to the pre-existing
	knowledge of Streptococcus virulence factors. RESULTS: Our analysis
	of 1730 gene clusters revealed 136 cases of positive Darwinian selection,
	which we suggest is most likely to result from an antagonistic interaction
	between the host and pathogen at the molecular level. A two-step
	validation procedure suggests that positive selection was robustly
	identified in our genomic survey. We found no evidence to support
	the notion that pathogen specific accessory genes are more likely
	to be subject to positive selection than core genes. Indeed, we even
	uncovered a few cases of essential gene evolution by positive selection.
	Among the gene clusters subject to positive selection, a large fraction
	(29\%) can be connected to virulence. The most striking finding was
	that a considerable fraction of the positively selected genes are
	also known to have tissue specific patterns of expression during
	invasive disease. As current expression data is far from comprehensive,
	we suggest that this fraction was underestimated. CONCLUSION: Our
	findings suggest that pathogen specific genes, although a popular
	focus of research, do not provide a complete picture of the evolutionary
	dynamics of virulence. The results of this study, and others, support
	the notion that the products of both core and accessory genes participate
	in complex networks that comprise the molecular basis of virulence.
	Future work should seek to understand the evolutionary dynamics of
	both core and accessory genes as a function of the networks in which
	they participate.},

  abstract = {With the easy acquisition of sequence data, it is now possible to

	method to reconstruct the whole distribution of phylogenetic trees
	along the genome, estimate the proportion of the genome for which
	a given clade is true, and infer a concordance tree that summarizes
	the dominant vertical inheritance pattern. There are two main issues
	with dealing with whole-genome alignments, as opposed to multiple
	genes: the size of the data, and the detection of recombination breakpoints.
	These breakpoints partition the genomic alignment into phylogenetically
	homogeneous loci, where sites within a given locus all share the
	same phylogenetic tree topology. To delimitate these loci, I describe
	here a method based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle,
	implemented with dynamic programming for computational efficiency.
	Simulations show that combining MDL partitioning with Bayesian concordance
	analysis provides an efficient and robust way to estimate both the
	vertical inheritance signal and the horizontal phylogenetic signal.
	The method performed well both in the presence of incomplete lineage
	sorting and in the presence of horizontal gene transfer. A high level

	(AP) covS mutant bacteria both in vitro and in vivo, and we found
	extensive transcriptional alterations of pathoadaptive and metabolic
	gene sets associated with invasion, immune evasion, tissue-dissemination,
	and metabolic reprogramming. In contrast to the virulence-associated
	differences between WT and AP bacteria, Phenotype Microarray analysis
	showed minor in vitro phenotypic differences between the two isogenic
	variants. Additionally, our results reflect that WT bacteria's rapid
	host-adaptive transcriptional reprogramming was not sufficient for
	their survival, and they were outnumbered by hypervirulent covS mutants
	with SpeB(-)/Sda(high) phenotype, which survived up to 14 days in
	mice chambers. Our findings demonstrate the engagement of unique
	regulatory modules in niche adaptation, implicate a critical role
	for bacterial genetic heterogeneity that surpasses transcriptional
	in vivo adaptation, and portray the dynamics underlying the selection
	of hypervirulent covS mutants over their parental WT cells.},

	In bacteria, these adaptive responses are generally mediated by two-component

	kinase (HK) and its cognate response regulator (RR). With the use
	of in silico techniques, a complete set of HKs and RRs was recovered
	from eight completely sequenced B. cereus group genomes. By applying
	a bidirectional best-hits method combined with gene neighbourhood
	analysis, a footprint of these proteins was made. Around 40 HK-RR
	gene pairs were detected in each member of the B. cereus group. In
	addition, each member contained many HK and RR genes not encoded
	in pairs ("orphans"). Classification of HKs and RRs based on their
	enzymic domains together with the analysis of two neighbour-joining
	trees of these domains revealed putative interaction partners for
	most of the "orphans". Putative biological functions, including involvement
	in virulence and host-microbe interactions, were predicted for the
	B. cereus group HKs and RRs by comparing them with those of B. subtilis
	and other micro-organisms. Remarkably, B. anthracis appeared to lack
	specific HKs and RRs and was found to contain many truncated, putatively
	non-functional, HK and RR genes. It is hypothesized that specialization
	of B. anthracis as a pathogen could have reduced the range of environmental
	stimuli to which it is exposed. This may have rendered some of its
	TCSs obsolete, ultimately resulting in the deletion of some HK and
	RR genes.},

	Serotype M3 strains of group A Streptococcus (GAS) are a common cause
	of severe invasive infections with unusually high rates of morbidity
	and mortality. To gain insight into the molecular basis of this high-virulence
	phenotype, we sequenced the genome of strain MGAS315, an organism
	isolated from a patient with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.
	The genome is composed of 1,900,521 bp, and it shares approximately
	1.7 Mb of related genetic material with genomes of serotype M1 and
	M18 strains. Phage-like elements account for the great majority of
	variation in gene content relative to the sequenced M1 and M18 strains.
	Recombination produces chimeric phages and strains with previously
	uncharacterized arrays of virulence factor genes. Strain MGAS315
	has phage genes that encode proteins likely to contribute to pathogenesis,
	such as streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin A (SpeA) and SpeK, streptococcal
	superantigen (SSA), and a previously uncharacterized phospholipase
	A(2) (designated Sla). Infected humans had anti-SpeK, -SSA, and -Sla
	antibodies, indicating that these GAS proteins are made in vivo.
	SpeK and SSA were pyrogenic and toxic for rabbits. Serotype M3 strains
	with the phage-encoded speK and sla genes increased dramatically
	in frequency late in the 20th century, commensurate with the rise
	in invasive disease caused by M3 organisms. Taken together, the results

	Markov model that incorporates comparative genomic data with traditional
	predictors, such as intergenic distances. The prediction algorithm
	performs as well as the best previously reported method, with several
	significant advantages. It uses fewer data sources and so it is easier
	to implement, and the method is more broadly applicable than previous
	methods--it can be applied to essentially every gene in any sequenced
	bacterial genome. Furthermore, we show that near-optimal performance
	is easily reached with a generic set of comparative genomes and does
	not depend on a specific relationship between the subject genome
	and the comparative set. We applied the algorithm to the Bacillus
	anthracis genome and found that it successfully predicted all previously
	verified B. anthracis operons. To further test its performance, we
	chose a predicted operon (BA1489-92) containing several genes with
	little apparent functional relatedness and tested their cotranscriptional
	nature. Experimental evidence shows that these genes are cotranscribed,
	and the data have interesting implications for B. anthracis biology.
	Overall, our findings show that this algorithm is capable of highly
	sensitive and accurate operon prediction in a wide range of bacterial
	genomes and that these predictions can lead to the rapid discovery
	of new functional relationships among genes.},

  year = {2008},

  pages = {59},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The M type-specific surface protein antigens encoded by
	the 5' end of emm genes are targets of protective host immunity and
	attractive vaccine candidates against infection by Streptococcus
	pyogenes, a global human pathogen. A history of genetic change in
	emm was evaluated for a worldwide collection of > 500 S. pyogenes
	isolates that were defined for genetic background by multilocus sequence
	typing of housekeeping genes. RESULTS: Organisms were categorized
	by genotypes that roughly correspond to throat specialists, skin
	specialists, and generalists often recovered from infections at either
	tissue site. Recovery of distant clones sharing the same emm type
	was approximately 4-fold higher for skin specialists and generalists,
	as compared to throat specialists. Importantly, emm type was often
	a poor marker for clone. Recovery of clones that underwent recombinational
	replacement with a new emm type was most evident for the throat and
	skin specialists. The average ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions
	per nonsynonymous site (Ka) and synonymous substitutions per synonymous
	site (Ks) was 4.9, 1.5 and 1.3 for emm types of the throat specialist,
	skin specialist and generalist groups, respectively. CONCLUSION:
	Data indicate that the relationships between emm type and genetic
	background differ among the three host tissue-related groups, and
	that the selection pressures acting on emm appear to be strongest
	for the throat specialists. Since positive selection is likely due
	in part to a protective host immune response, the findings may have
	important implications for vaccine design and vaccination strategies.},

	acid capsule. Most of these genes, including covR itself, are negatively
	regulated by CovR. We have isolated two independent ISS1 insertions
	in an open reading frame (ORF) that increases CovR expression as
	measured by a Pcov-gusA reporter fusion in single copy in the GAS
	chromosome. This ORF, named rocA for "regulator of Cov," activates
	covR transcription about threefold. As expected, a rocA mutant is
	mucoid and produces more transcript from the has promoter since this
	promoter is repressed by CovR. This effect is dependent on the presence
	of a wild-type covR gene. In contrast to its activation of Pcov,
	RocA negatively regulates its own expression. This autoregulation
	is not dependent on the presence of the covR gene. All the phenotypes
	of the rocA mutant were complemented by the presence of the rocA
	gene on a plasmid. The rocA gene is present in strains of all nine
	M serotypes of GAS tested and is absent from strains representing
	11 other groups of streptococci and related bacteria, including strains
	of the closely related group C and G streptococci. It seems likely
	that rocA plays an important role in the pathogenesis of GAS since

	coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since
	evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which
	E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population
	evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for >30,000 generations,
	although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using
	(Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations,
	causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed
	and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement
	of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary
	mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression
	is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these
	hypotheses in experiments that "replayed" evolution from different
	points in that population's history. We observed no Cit+ mutants
	among 8.4 x 10(12) ancestral cells, nor among 9 x 10(12) cells from
	60 clones sampled in the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed
	a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+,
	indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations.
	This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but
	did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of
	this phenotype was contingent on the particular history of that population.
	More generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially
	important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that
	are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.},

	A. (2009). Comprehensive comparative analysis of strand-specific
	RNA sequencing methods. Nat. Methods7(9), 709-715]. The procedure
	starts with the isolation of the polyA fraction (mRNA) within a pool
	of total RNA, followed by its fragmentation. Then double-stranded
	(ds) cDNA synthesis is performed with the incorporation of dUTP in
	the second strand. The ds cDNA fragments are further processed following
	a standard sequencing library preparation scheme tailored for the
	Illumina sequencing platform: end polishing, A-tailing, adapter ligation,
	and size selection. Prior to final amplification, the dUTP-marked
	strand is selectively degraded by Uracil-DNA-Glycosylase (UDG). The
	remaining strand is amplified to generate a cDNA library suitable

	hand but puts it into the context of the complete regulatory network.
	RESULTS: Here, we present an alignment- and threshold-free comparative
	genomics approach for assigning functional roles to DNA regulatory
	motifs. We incorporate our approach into the Gomo algorithm, a computational
	tool for detecting associations between a user-specified DNA regulatory
	motif [expressed as a position weight matrix (PWM)] and Gene Ontology
	(GO) terms. Incorporating multiple species into the analysis significantly
	improves Gomo's ability to identify GO terms associated with the
	regulatory targets of TFs. Including three comparative species in
	the process of predicting TF roles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
	Homo sapiens increases the number of significant predictions by 75
	and 200\%, respectively. The predicted GO terms are also more specific,
	yielding deeper biological insight into the role of the TF. Adjusting
	motif (binding) affinity scores for individual sequence composition
	proves to be essential for avoiding false positive associations.
	We describe a novel DNA sequence-scoring algorithm that compensates
	a thermodynamic measure of DNA-binding affinity for individual sequence
	base composition. GOMO's prediction accuracy proves to be relatively
	insensitive to how promoters are defined. Because GOMO uses a threshold-free
	form of gene set analysis, there are no free parameters to tune.
	Biologists can investigate the potential roles of DNA regulatory
	motifs of interest using GOMO via the web (http://meme.nbcr.net).},

	CNSs may arise from nonselective evolutionary processes such as genomic

	insect genome projects with population genetic data in Drosophila
	melanogaster to test predictions of the mutational cold spot model

	in intronic and intergenic CNSs exhibit a significant reduction in
	levels of divergence relative to levels of polymorphism, as well
	as a significant excess of rare derived alleles, compared with either
	the nonconserved spacer regions between CNSs or with 4-fold silent
	sites in coding regions. Controlling for the effects of purifying
	selection, we find no evidence of positive selection acting on Drosophila
	CNSs, although we do find evidence for the action of recurrent positive
	selection in the spacer regions between CNSs. We estimate that approximately
	85\% of sites in Drosophila CNSs are under constraint with selection
	coefficients (N(e)s) on the order of 10-100, and thus, the estimated
	strength and number of sites under purifying selection is greater
	for Drosophila CNSs relative to those in the human genome. These
	patterns of nonneutral molecular evolution are incompatible with
	the mutational cold spot hypothesis to explain the existence of CNSs
	in Drosophila and, coupled with similar findings in mammals, argue
	against the general likelihood that CNSs are generated by mutational

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {412},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic recombination can produce heterogeneous phylogenetic
	histories within a set of homologous genes. These recombination events
	can be obscured by subsequent residue substitutions, which consequently
	complicate their detection. While there are many algorithms for the
	identification of recombination events, little is known about the
	effects of subsequent substitutions on the accuracy of available
	recombination-detection approaches. RESULTS: We assessed the effect
	of subsequent substitutions on the detection of simulated recombination
	events within sets of four nucleotide sequences under a homogeneous
	evolutionary model. The amount of subsequent substitutions per site,
	prior evolutionary history of the sequences, and reciprocality or
	non-reciprocality of the recombination event all affected the accuracy
	of the recombination-detecting programs examined. Bayesian phylogenetic-based
	approaches showed high accuracy in detecting evidence of recombination
	event and in identifying recombination breakpoints. These approaches
	were less sensitive to parameter settings than other methods we tested,
	making them easier to apply to various data sets in a consistent
	manner. CONCLUSION: Post-recombination substitutions tend to diminish
	the predictive accuracy of recombination-detecting programs. The
	best method for detecting recombined regions is not necessarily the
	most accurate in identifying recombination breakpoints. For difficult
	detection problems involving highly divergent sequences or large
	data sets, different types of approach can be run in succession to
	increase efficiency, and can potentially yield better predictive
	accuracy than any single method used in isolation.},

	that, in contrast to the other CovR-repressed promoters, Pska regulation
	by CovR occurs through binding at a single ATTARA consensus binding
	sequence (CB) that overlaps the -10 region of the promoter. Binding
	of CovR to other nearby consensus sequences occurs upon phosphorylation
	of the protein, but these other CBs do not contribute to the regulation
	of Pska by CovR. Thus, binding at a specific site does not necessarily
	indicate that the site is involved in regulation by CovR. In addition,
	at Pska, CovR binding to the different sites does not appear to involve
	cooperative interactions, which simplifies the analysis of CovR binding
	and gives us insight into the modes of interaction that occur between
	CovR and its specific DNA-binding sites. Finally, the observation
	that regulation of transcription from Pska occurs at a very low concentration
	of phosphorylated CovR may have important implications for the regulation

  abstract = {Macrogenomic events, in which genes are gained and lost, play a pivotal
	evolutionary role in microbial evolution. Nevertheless, probabilistic-evolutionary
	models describing such events and methods for their robust inference
	are considerably less developed than existing methodologies for analyzing
	site-specific sequence evolution. Here, we present a novel method
	for the inference of gains and losses of gene families. First, we
	develop probabilistic-evolutionary models describing the dynamics
	of gene-family content, which are more biologically realistic than
	previously suggested models. In our likelihood-based models, gains
	and losses are represented by transitions between presence and absence,
	given an underlying phylogeny. We employ a mixture-model approach
	in which we allow both the gain rate and the loss rate to vary among
	gene families. Second, we use these models together with the analytic
	implementation of stochastic mapping to infer branch-specific events.
	Our novel methodology allows us to infer and quantify horizontal
	gene transfer (HGT) events. This enables us to rank various gene
	families and lineages according to their propensity to undergo gains
	and losses. Applying our methodology to 4,873 gene families shows
	that: 1) the novel mixture models describe the observed variability
	in gene-family content among microbes significantly better than previous
	models; 2) The stochastic mapping approach enables accurate inference
	of gain and loss events based on simulations; 3) At least 34\% of
	the gene families analyzed are inferred to have experienced HGT at
	least once during their evolution; and 4) Gene families that were
	inferred to experience HGT are both enriched and depleted with respect
	to specific functional categories.},

	To study the evolution of complete gene repertoires, we propose here
	a mathematical framework that does not rely on resolved gene family
	histories. We show that so-called phylogenetic profiles, formed by
	family sizes across multiple genomes, are sufficient to infer principal

	a model of birth-and-death processes acting on a phylogeny. We examine
	known gene families in 28 archaeal genomes using a probabilistic
	model that involves lineage- and family-specific components of gene
	acquisition, duplication, and loss. The model enables us to consider
	all possible histories when inferring statistics about archaeal evolution.
	According to our reconstruction, most lineages are characterized
	by a net loss of gene families. Major increases in gene repertoire
	have occurred only a few times. Our reconstruction underlines the
	importance of persistent streamlining processes in shaping genome
	composition in Archaea. It also suggests that early archaeal genomes

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple genome alignment remains a challenging problem.
	Effects of recombination including rearrangement, segmental duplication,
	gain, and loss can create a mosaic pattern of homology even among
	closely related organisms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe
	a new method to align two or more genomes that have undergone rearrangements
	due to recombination and substantial amounts of segmental gain and
	loss (flux). We demonstrate that the new method can accurately align
	regions conserved in some, but not all, of the genomes, an important
	case not handled by our previous work. The method uses a novel alignment
	objective score called a sum-of-pairs breakpoint score, which facilitates
	accurate detection of rearrangement breakpoints when genomes have
	unequal gene content. We also apply a probabilistic alignment filtering
	method to remove erroneous alignments of unrelated sequences, which
	are commonly observed in other genome alignment methods. We describe
	new metrics for quantifying genome alignment accuracy which measure
	the quality of rearrangement breakpoint predictions and indel predictions.
	The new genome alignment algorithm demonstrates high accuracy in
	situations where genomes have undergone biologically feasible amounts
	of genome rearrangement, segmental gain and loss. We apply the new
	algorithm to a set of 23 genomes from the genera Escherichia, Shigella,
	and Salmonella. Analysis of whole-genome multiple alignments allows
	us to extend the previously defined concepts of core- and pan-genomes
	to include not only annotated genes, but also non-coding regions
	with potential regulatory roles. The 23 enterobacteria have an estimated
	core-genome of 2.46Mbp conserved among all taxa and a pan-genome
	of 15.2Mbp. We document substantial population-level variability
	among these organisms driven by segmental gain and loss. Interestingly,
	much variability lies in intergenic regions, suggesting that the
	Enterobacteriacae may exhibit regulatory divergence. CONCLUSIONS:
	The multiple genome alignments generated by our software provide
	a platform for comparative genomic and population genomic studies.

  abstract = {Genome structure variation has profound impacts on phenotype in organisms
	ranging from microbes to humans, yet little is known about how natural
	selection acts on genome arrangement. Pathogenic bacteria such as
	Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic and pneumonic plague, often
	exhibit a high degree of genomic rearrangement. The recent availability
	of several Yersinia genomes offers an unprecedented opportunity to
	study the evolution of genome structure and arrangement. We introduce
	a set of statistical methods to study patterns of rearrangement in
	circular chromosomes and apply them to the Yersinia. We constructed
	a multiple alignment of eight Yersinia genomes using Mauve software
	to identify 78 conserved segments that are internally free from genome
	rearrangement. Based on the alignment, we applied Bayesian statistical
	methods to infer the phylogenetic inversion history of Yersinia.
	The sampling of genome arrangement reconstructions contains seven
	parsimonious tree topologies, each having different histories of
	79 inversions. Topologies with a greater number of inversions also
	exist, but were sampled less frequently. The inversion phylogenies
	agree with results suggested by SNP patterns. We then analyzed reconstructed
	inversion histories to identify patterns of rearrangement. We confirm
	an over-representation of "symmetric inversions"-inversions with
	endpoints that are equally distant from the origin of chromosomal
	replication. Ancestral genome arrangements demonstrate moderate preference
	for replichore balance in Yersinia. We found that all inversions
	are shorter than expected under a neutral model, whereas inversions
	acting within a single replichore are much shorter than expected.
	We also found evidence for a canonical configuration of the origin
	and terminus of replication. Finally, breakpoint reuse analysis reveals
	that inversions with endpoints proximal to the origin of DNA replication
	are nearly three times more frequent. Our findings represent the
	first characterization of genome arrangement evolution in a bacterial
	population evolving outside laboratory conditions. Insight into the
	process of genomic rearrangement may further the understanding of
	pathogen population dynamics and selection on the architecture of
	circular bacterial chromosomes.},

  abstract = {Lateral gene transfer is a significant contributor to the ongoing
	evolution of many bacterial pathogens, including beta-hemolytic streptococci.
	Here we provide the first characterization of a novel integrative
	conjugative element (ICE), ICESde3396, from Streptococcus dysgalactiae
	subsp. equisimilis (group G streptococcus [GGS]), a bacterium commonly
	found in the throat and skin of humans. ICESde3396 is 64 kb in size
	and encodes 66 putative open reading frames. ICESde3396 shares 38
	open reading frames with a putative ICE from Streptococcus agalactiae
	(group B streptococcus [GBS]), ICESa2603. In addition to genes involves
	in conjugal processes, ICESde3396 also carries genes predicted to
	be involved in virulence and resistance to various metals. A major
	feature of ICESde3396 differentiating it from ICESa2603 is the presence
	of an 18-kb internal recombinogenic region containing four unique
	gene clusters, which appear to have been acquired from streptococcal
	and nonstreptococcal bacterial species. The four clusters include
	two cadmium resistance operons, an arsenic resistance operon, and
	genes with orthologues in a group A streptococcus (GAS) prophage.
	Streptococci that naturally harbor ICESde3396 have increased resistance
	to cadmium and arsenate, indicating the functionality of genes present
	in the 18-kb recombinogenic region. By marking ICESde3396 with a
	kanamycin resistance gene, we demonstrate that the ICE is transferable
	to other GGS isolates as well as GBS and GAS. To investigate the
	presence of the ICE in clinical streptococcal isolates, we screened
	69 isolates (30 GGS, 19 GBS, and 20 GAS isolates) for the presence
	of three separate regions of ICESde3396. Eleven isolates possessed
	all three regions, suggesting they harbored ICESde3396-like elements.
	Another four isolates possessed ICESa2603-like elements. We propose
	that ICESde3396 is a mobile genetic element that is capable of acquiring
	DNA from multiple bacterial sources and is a vehicle for dissemination
	of this DNA through the wider beta-hemolytic streptococcal population.},

	represses the induction of the T3 gene regulatory cascade consisting

	The repressor activity of RhpR is inhibited by RhpS, which presumably

	five genes that were upregulated and two genes that were downregulated

	that have revealed many features of this process. Here we focus on
	genetic exchange that has involved homologous recombination and illustrate
	how nucleotide sequence data have furthered our understanding of:
	(i) the frequency of recombination; (ii) the impact of recombination
	in different parts of the genome; and (iii) patterns of gene flow
	within bacterial populations. Summarizing the results obtained for
	a range of bacteria, we survey evidence indicating that the extent
	and nature of recombination vary widely among microbiological species
	and often among lineages assigned to the same microbiological species.
	These results have important implications in studies ranging from
	epidemiological investigations to examination of the bacterial species

	Divergence within cis-regulatory sequences may result from the evolution

	of the cis-regulatory code. The identification of functional divergence
	in cis-regulatory sequences is therefore important for both understanding
	the role of gene regulation in evolution and annotating regulatory
	elements. We have developed an evolutionary model to detect the loss
	of constraint on individual transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs).
	We find that a significant fraction of functionally constrained binding
	sites have been lost in a lineage-specific manner among three closely
	related yeast species. Binding site loss has previously been explained
	by turnover, where the concurrent gain and loss of a binding site
	maintains gene regulation. We estimate that nearly half of all loss
	events cannot be explained by binding site turnover. Recreating the
	mutations that led to binding site loss confirms that these sequence
	changes affect gene expression in some cases. We also estimate that
	there is a high rate of binding site gain, as more than half of experimentally
	identified S. cerevisiae binding sites are not conserved across species.
	The frequent gain and loss of TFBSs implies that cis-regulatory sequences
	are labile and, in the absence of turnover, may contribute to species-specific

	While inbreeding depression and heterosis imply that a substantial

	deleterious and neutral DNA sequence variation within Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae, we sequenced the genome of a vineyard and oak tree strain

	6\% of the genome is variable, mostly attributable to variation in
	genome content that results from large InDels. Out of the 88,000
	polymorphisms identified, 93\% are SNPs and a small but significant
	fraction can be attributed to recent interspecific introgression
	and ectopic gene conversion. In comparison to the reference genome,
	there is substantial evidence for functional variation in gene content
	and structure that results from large InDels, frame-shifts, and polymorphic
	start and stop codons. Comparison of polymorphism to divergence reveals
	scant evidence for positive selection but an abundance of evidence

	The gene tree/species tree reconciliation approach has been widely

	that considers only the reconciliation that minimizes the number
	of duplication and/or loss events. Recently a probabilistic approach
	has been developed, based on the classical birth-death process, including
	efficient algorithms for computing posterior probabilities of reconciliations

	algorithm for exploring the whole space of gene tree/species tree
	reconciliations, that we adapt here to compute efficiently, either
	exactly or approximately depending on the space size, the posterior
	probability of the visited reconciliations.We use this algorithm
	to analyze the probabilistic landscape of the space of reconciliations
	for, both, a real dataset of fungal gene families and simulated data.
	Conclusion. Our results suggest that with realistic gene duplication
	and loss rates, a very small subset of all reconciliations needs
	to be explored in order to approximate very closely the posterior
	probability of the most likely reconciliations. For cases where the
	posterior probability mass is more evenly dispersed, our method allows

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: New "next generation" DNA sequencing technologies offer
	individual researchers the ability to rapidly generate large amounts
	of genome sequence data at dramatically reduced costs. As a result,
	a need has arisen for new software tools for storage, management
	and analysis of genome sequence data. Although bioinformatic tools
	are available for the analysis and management of genome sequences,
	limitations still remain. For example, restrictions on the submission
	of data and use of these tools may be imposed, thereby making them
	unsuitable for sequencing projects that need to remain in-house or
	proprietary during their initial stages. Furthermore, the availability
	and use of next generation sequencing in industrial, governmental
	and academic environments requires biologist to have access to computational
	support for the curation and analysis of the data generated; however,
	this type of support is not always immediately available. RESULTS:
	To address these limitations, we have developed DraGnET (Draft Genome
	Evaluation Tool). DraGnET is an open source web application which
	allows researchers, with no experience in programming and database
	management, to setup their own in-house projects for storing, retrieving,
	organizing and managing annotated draft and complete genome sequence
	data. The software provides a web interface for the use of BLAST,
	allowing users to perform preliminary comparative analysis among
	multiple genomes. We demonstrate the utility of DraGnET for performing
	comparative genomics on closely related bacterial strains. Furthermore,
	DraGnET can be further developed to incorporate additional tools
	for more sophisticated analyses. CONCLUSIONS: DraGnET is designed
	for use either by individual researchers or as a collaborative tool
	available through Internet (or Intranet) deployment. For genome projects
	that require genome sequencing data to initially remain proprietary,
	DraGnET provides the means for researchers to keep their data in-house
	for analysis using local programs or until it is made publicly available,
	at which point it may be uploaded to additional analysis software
	applications. The DraGnET home page is available at http://www.dragnet.cvm.iastate.edu
	and includes example files for examining the functionalities, a link
	for downloading the DraGnET setup package and a link to the DraGnET

	phylogenetic signal in gene content to be applied to any set of sequences,
	using signature genes for phylogenetic classification. The hundreds
	of publicly available genomes allow us to identify signature genes
	at various taxonomic depths, and we show how the presence of signature
	genes in an unspecified sample can be used to characterize its taxonomic
	composition. We identify 8,362 signature genes specific for 112 prokaryotic
	taxa. We show that these signature genes can be used to address phylogenetic
	questions on the basis of gene content in cases where classic gene
	content or sequence analyses provide an ambiguous answer, such as
	for Nanoarchaeum equitans, and even in cases where complete genomes
	are not available, such as for metagenomics data. Cross-validation
	experiments leaving out up to 30\% of the species show that approximately
	92\% of the signature genes correctly place the species in a related
	clade. Analyses of metagenomics data sets with the signature gene
	approach are in good agreement with the previously reported species
	distributions based on phylogenetic analysis of marker genes. Summarizing,
	signature genes can complement traditional sequence-based methods
	in addressing taxonomic questions.},

	high false positives. Of the alignment methods evaluated, PRANK consistently
	outperformed MUSCLE, MAFFT, and ClustalW, mostly because the latter

	The vast majority of human samples available for research are obtained

	We find that death induces significant expression changes in more

	similar expression changes due to death in two distinct brain regions.
	Consequently, the pattern of gene expression differences between
	the two brain regions is largely unaffected by death, although the
	magnitude of differences is reduced by 50\% in postmortem samples.
	Furthermore, death-induced changes do not contribute significantly
	to gene expression variation among postmortem human brain samples.We
	conclude that postmortem human brain samples are suitable for investigating
	gene expression patterns in humans, but that caution is warranted
	in interpreting results for individual genes.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT:Next-generation sequencing is providing researchers with
	a relatively fast and affordable option for developing genomic resources
	for organisms that are not among the traditional genetic models.
	Here we present a de novo assembly of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata)
	transcriptome using 454 sequence reads, and we evaluate potential
	uses of this transcriptome, including detection of sex-specific transcripts
	and deployment as a reference for gene expression analysis in guppies
	and a related species. Guppies have been model organisms in ecology,
	evolutionary biology, and animal behaviour for over 100 years. An
	annotated transcriptome and other genomic tools will facilitate understanding
	the genetic and molecular bases of adaptation and variation in a
	vertebrate species with a uniquely well known natural history.We
	generated approximately 336 Mbp of mRNA sequence data from male brain,
	male body, female brain, and female body. The resulting 1,162,670
	reads assembled into 54,921 contigs, creating a reference transcriptome
	for the guppy with an average read depth of 28×. We annotated nearly
	40\% of this reference transcriptome by searching protein and gene
	ontology databases. Using this annotated transcriptome database,
	we identified candidate genes of interest to the guppy research community,
	putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and male-specific
	expressed genes. We also showed that our reference transcriptome
	can be used for RNA-sequencing-based analysis of differential gene
	expression. We identified transcripts that, in juveniles, are regulated
	differently in the presence and absence of an important predator,
	Rivulus hartii, including two genes implicated in stress response.
	For each sample in the RNA-seq study, >50\% of high-quality reads
	mapped to unique sequences in the reference database with high confidence.
	In addition, we evaluated the use of the guppy reference transcriptome
	for gene expression analyses in a congeneric species, the sailfin
	molly (Poecilia latipinna). Over 40\% of reads from the sailfin molly
	sample aligned to the guppy transcriptome.We show that next-generation
	sequencing provided a reliable and broad reference transcriptome.
	This resource allowed us to identify candidate gene variants, SNPs
	in coding regions, and sex-specific gene expression, and permitted
	quantitative analysis of differential gene expression.},

  pages = {80},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome sequence alignments form the basis of much research.
	Genome alignment depends on various mundane but critical choices,
	such as how to mask repeats and which score parameters to use. Surprisingly,
	there has been no large-scale assessment of these choices using real
	genomic data. Moreover, rigorous procedures to control the rate of
	spurious alignment have not been employed. RESULTS: We have assessed
	495 combinations of score parameters for alignment of animal, plant,
	and fungal genomes. As our gold-standard of accuracy, we used genome
	alignments implied by multiple alignments of proteins and of structural
	RNAs. We found the HOXD scoring schemes underlying alignments in
	the UCSC genome database to be far from optimal, and suggest better
	parameters. Higher values of the X-drop parameter are not always
	better. E-values accurately indicate the rate of spurious alignment,
	but only if tandem repeats are masked in a non-standard way. Finally,
	we show that gamma-centroid (probabilistic) alignment can find highly
	reliable subsets of aligned bases. CONCLUSIONS: These results enable
	more accurate genome alignment, with reliability measures for local
	alignments and for individual aligned bases. This study was made
	possible by our new software, LAST, which can align vertebrate genomes

	bacterial phylogenomics is a controversial issue. This debate, however,

	I introduce a Markov model of genome evolution with HGT, accounting
	for the constraints on time -- an HGT event can only occur between
	concomitantly living species. This model is used to simulate multigene
	sequence data sets with or without HGT. The consequences of HGT on

	phylogenetic artefacts. It is found that supertree methods are quite
	robust to HGT, keeping high levels of performance even when gene
	trees are largely incongruent with each other. Gene tree incongruence
	per se is not indicative of HGT. HGT, however, removes the (otherwise
	observed) positive relationship between sequence length and gene
	tree congruence to the estimated species tree. Surprisingly, when
	applied to a bacterial and a eukaryotic multigene data set, this
	criterion rejects the HGT hypothesis for the former, but not the

	understanding gene regulation. In this paper, we address the problem
	of predicting the location of promoters and their transcription start
	sites (TSSs) in Escherichia coli. The accepted method for this problem
	is to use position weight matrices (PWMs), which define conserved
	motifs at the sigma-factor binding site. However this method is known
	to result in large numbers of false positive predictions. RESULTS:
	Our approaches to TSS prediction are based upon an ensemble of support
	vector machines (SVMs) employing a variant of the mismatch string
	kernel. This classifier is subsequently combined with a PWM and a
	model based on distribution of distances from TSS to gene start.
	We investigate the effect of different scoring techniques and quantify
	performance using area under a detection-error tradeoff curve. When
	tested on a biologically realistic task, our method provides performance
	comparable with or superior to the best reported for this task. False
	positives are significantly reduced, an improvement of great significance
	to biologists. AVAILABILITY: The trained ensemble-SVM model with

	to infer the gene content and gene order that existed in the genome
	of an extinct ancestral yeast about 100 Mya, immediately before it
	underwent whole-genome duplication (WGD). The reconstructed ancestral
	genome contains 4,703 ordered loci on eight chromosomes. The reconstruction
	is complete except for the subtelomeric regions. We then inferred
	the series of rearrangement steps that led from this ancestor to
	the current Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome; relative to the ancestral
	genome we observe 73 inversions, 66 reciprocal translocations, and
	five translocations involving telomeres. Some fragile chromosomal
	sites were reused as evolutionary breakpoints multiple times. We
	identified 124 genes that have been gained by S. cerevisiae in the
	time since the WGD, including one that is derived from a hAT family
	transposon, and 88 ancestral loci at which S. cerevisiae did not
	retain either of the gene copies that were formed by WGD. Sites of
	gene gain and evolutionary breakpoints both tend to be associated
	with tRNA genes and, to a lesser extent, with origins of replication.
	Many of the gained genes in S. cerevisiae have functions associated

	regions of the genome are found outside those that encode proteins,
	and noncoding regions of the genome have been shown to be subject
	to substantial levels of selective constraint, particularly in Drosophila.
	Recent work has suggested that these regions may also have been subject
	to the action of positive selection, with large fractions of noncoding
	divergence having been driven to fixation by adaptive evolution.
	However, this work has focused on Drosophila melanogaster, which
	is thought to have experienced a reduction in effective population
	size (N(e)), and thus a reduction in the efficacy of selection, compared
	with its closest relative Drosophila simulans. Here, we examine patterns
	of evolution at several classes of noncoding DNA in D. simulans and
	find that all noncoding DNA is subject to the action of negative
	selection, indicated by reduced levels of polymorphism and divergence
	and a skew in the frequency spectrum toward rare variants. We find
	that the signature of negative selection on noncoding DNA and nonsynonymous
	sites is obscured to some extent by purifying selection acting on
	preferred to unpreferred synonymous codon mutations. We investigate
	the extent to which divergence in noncoding DNA is inferred to be
	the product of positive selection and to what extent these inferences
	depend on selection on synonymous sites and demography. Based on
	patterns of polymorphism and divergence for different classes of
	synonymous substitution, we find the divergence excess inferred in
	noncoding DNA and nonsynonymous sites in the D. simulans lineage

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {476},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has allowed bacteria to
	evolve many new capabilities. Because transferred genes perform many
	medically important functions, such as conferring antibiotic resistance,
	improved detection of horizontally transferred genes from sequence
	data would be an important advance. Existing sequence-based methods
	for detecting HGT focus on changes in nucleotide composition or on
	differences between gene and genome phylogenies; these methods have
	high error rates. RESULTS: First, we introduce a new class of methods
	for detecting HGT based on the changes in nucleotide substitution
	rates that occur when a gene is transferred to a new organism. Our
	new methods discriminate simulated HGT events with an error rate
	up to 10 times lower than does GC content. Use of models that are
	not time-reversible is crucial for detecting HGT. Second, we show
	that using combinations of multiple predictors of HGT offers substantial
	improvements over using any single predictor, yielding as much as
	a factor of 18 improvement in performance (a maximum reduction in
	error rate from 38\% to about 3\%). Multiple predictors were combined
	by using the random forests machine learning algorithm to identify
	optimal classifiers that separate HGT from non-HGT trees. CONCLUSION:
	The new class of HGT-detection methods introduced here combines advantages
	of phylogenetic and compositional HGT-detection techniques. These
	new techniques offer order-of-magnitude improvements over compositional
	methods because they are better able to discriminate HGT from non-HGT
	trees under a wide range of simulated conditions. We also found that
	combining multiple measures of HGT is essential for detecting a wide
	range of HGT events. These novel indicators of horizontal transfer
	will be widely useful in detecting HGT events linked to the evolution
	of important bacterial traits, such as antibiotic resistance and
	pathogenicity.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large scale genome arrangement, such as whole gene insertion/deletion,
	plays an important role in bacterial genome evolution. Various methods
	have been employed to study the dynamic process of gene insertions
	and deletions, such as parsimony methods and maximum likelihood methods.
	Previous maximum likelihood studies have assumed that the rate of
	gene insertions/deletions is constant over different genes. This
	assumption is unrealistic. For instance, it has been shown that informational
	genes are less likely to be laterally transferred than non-informational
	genes. However, how much of the variation in gene transfer rates
	is due to the difference between informational genes and non-informational
	genes is unclear. In this study, a Gamma-distribution was incorporated
	in the likelihood estimation by considering rate variation for gene
	insertions/deletions between genes. This makes it possible to address
	whether a difference between informational genes and non-informational
	genes is the main contributor to rate variation of lateral gene transfers.
	RESULTS: The results show that models incorporating rate variation
	fit the data better than do constant rate models in many phylogenetic
	groups. Even though informational genes are less likely to be laterally
	transferred than non-informational genes, the degree of rate variation
	for insertions/deletions did not change dramatically and remained
	high even when informational genes were excluded from the study.
	This suggests that the variation in rate of insertions/deletions
	is not due mainly to the simple difference between informational
	genes and non-informational genes. Among genes that are not classified
	as informational and among the informational genes themselves, there
	are still large differences in the rates that these genes are inserted
	and deleted. CONCLUSION: While the difference in informational gene
	rates contributes to rate variation, it is only a small fraction
	of the variation present; instead, a substantial amount of rate variation
	for insertions/deletions remains among both informational genes and
	among non-informational genes.},

	50 bacterial complete genomes from nine groups. For each group we
	use a 16s rRNA phylogeny and a comparison of protein similarity to
	map gene insertions/deletions onto their species phylogeny. The results
	reveal that there is poor correlation of genes inserted, deleted,
	and duplicated with evolutionary branch length. In addition, the
	numbers of genes inserted, deleted, or duplicated within the same
	branch are not always correlated with each other. Nor is there any
	similarity within groups. For example, in the Rhizobiales group,
	the ratio of insertions to deletions in the evolutionary branch leading
	to Agrobacterium tumefaciens str. C58 (Cereon) is 0.52, but it is
	39.52 for Mesorhizobium loti. Most strikingly, the number of insertions
	of foreign genes is much larger in the external branches of the trees.
	These insertions also greatly outnumber the occurrence of deletions,
	and yet the genome sizes of these bacteria remain roughly constant.
	This indicates that many of the insertions are specific to each organism
	and are lost before related species can evolve. Simulations of the
	process of insertion and deletion, tailored to each phylogeny, support

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: A variety of algorithms have been developed to predict
	transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) within the genome by exploiting
	the evolutionary information implicit in multiple alignments of the
	genomes of related species. One such approach uses an extension of
	the standard position-specific motif model that incorporates phylogenetic
	information via a phylogenetic tree and a model of evolution. However,
	these phylogenetic motif models (PMMs) have never been rigorously
	benchmarked in order to determine whether they lead to better prediction
	of TFBSs than obtained using simple position weight matrix scanning.
	RESULTS: We evaluate three PMM-based prediction algorithms, each
	of which uses a different treatment of gapped alignments, and we
	compare their prediction accuracy with that of a non-phylogenetic
	motif scanning approach. Surprisingly, all of these algorithms appear
	to be inferior to simple motif scanning, when accuracy is measured
	using a gold standard of validated yeast TFBSs. However, the PMM
	scanners perform much better than simple motif scanning when we abandon
	the gold standard and consider the number of statistically significant
	sites predicted, using column-shuffled 'random' motifs to measure
	significance. These results suggest that the common practice of measuring
	the accuracy of binding site predictors using collections of known
	sites may be dangerously misleading since such collections may be
	missing 'weak' sites, which are exactly the type of sites needed
	to discriminate among predictors. We then extend our previous theoretical
	model of the statistical power of PMM-based prediction algorithms
	to allow for loss of binding sites during evolution, and show that
	it gives a more accurate upper bound on scanner accuracy. Finally,
	utilizing our theoretical model, we introduce a new method for predicting
	the number of real binding sites in a genome. The results suggest
	that the number of true sites for a yeast TF is in general several
	times greater than the number of known sites listed in the Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae Database (SCPD). Among the three scanning algorithms that
	we test, the MONKEY algorithm has the highest accuracy for predicting
	yeast TFBSs.},

  abstract = {Cross-species comparison has emerged as a powerful paradigm for predicting
	cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) and understanding their evolution.
	The comparison requires reliable sequence alignment, which remains
	a challenging task for less conserved noncoding sequences. Furthermore,
	the existing models of DNA sequence evolution generally do not explicitly
	treat the special properties of CRM sequences. To address these limitations,
	we propose a model of CRM evolution that captures different modes
	of evolution of functional transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)
	and the background sequences. A particularly novel aspect of our
	work is a probabilistic model of gains and losses of TFBSs, a process
	being recognized as an important part of regulatory sequence evolution.
	We present a computational framework that uses this model to solve
	the problems of CRM alignment and prediction. Our alignment method
	is similar to existing methods of statistical alignment but uses
	the conserved binding sites to improve alignment. Our CRM prediction
	method deals with the inherent uncertainties of binding site annotations
	and sequence alignment in a probabilistic framework. In simulated
	as well as real data, we demonstrate that our program is able to
	improve both alignment and prediction of CRM sequences over several
	state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we used alignments produced by
	our program to study binding site conservation in genome-wide binding
	data of key transcription factors in the Drosophila blastoderm, with
	two intriguing results: (i) the factor-bound sequences are under

	to improve our mechanistic understanding of transcriptional regulation.
	However, the few models available today have been based on simplistic
	assumptions about the sequences being modeled, or heuristic approximations
	of the underlying regulatory mechanisms. We have developed a thermodynamics-based
	model to predict gene expression driven by any DNA sequence, as a
	function of transcription factor concentrations and their DNA-binding
	specificities. It uses statistical thermodynamics theory to model
	not only protein-DNA interaction, but also the effect of DNA-bound
	activators and repressors on gene expression. In addition, the model
	incorporates mechanistic features such as synergistic effect of multiple
	activators, short range repression, and cooperativity in transcription
	factor-DNA binding, allowing us to systematically evaluate the significance
	of these features in the context of available expression data. Using
	this model on segmentation-related enhancers in Drosophila, we find
	that transcriptional synergy due to simultaneous action of multiple
	activators helps explain the data beyond what can be explained by
	cooperative DNA-binding alone. We find clear support for the phenomenon
	of short-range repression, where repressors do not directly interact
	with the basal transcriptional machinery. We also find that the binding
	sites contributing to an enhancer's function may not be conserved
	during evolution, and a noticeable fraction of these undergo lineage-specific
	changes. Our implementation of the model, called GEMSTAT, is the
	first publicly available program for simultaneously modeling the

	The regulation of target gene expression by transcription factors

	of regulators with TF binding sites (TFBSs) in cis-regulatory regions.
	A factor that in large part determines the strength of the response

	the TFBS fits the optimal TFBS sequence for a given TF. Advances

	To optimize the prediction of transcriptional regulatory networks,
	i.e., to separate direct regulation from indirect regulation, a thorough

	the commonly used synonymous/nonsynonymous mutation models for protein-coding

	assumptions, it captures enough of the biology of transcription factor
	action to show clear correlation with other biological features.
	Sunflower predicts a binding profile of transcription factors to
	DNA sequences, in which different factors compete for the same potential
	binding sites. The parametrized model simultaneously estimates a
	continuous measurement of binding occupancy across the genomic sequence
	for each factor. We can then introduce a localized mutation, rerun
	the binding model, and record the difference in binding profiles.
	A single mutation can alter interactions both upstream and downstream
	of its position due to potential overlapping binding sites, and our
	statistic captures this domino effect. Over evolutionary time, we
	observe a clear excess of low-scoring mutations fixed in promoters,
	consistent with most changes being neutral. However, this is not
	consistent across all promoters, and some promoters show more rapid
	divergence. This divergence often occurs in the presence of relatively
	constant protein-coding divergence. Interestingly, different classes
	of promoters show different sensitivity to mutations, with phosphorylation-related
	genes having promoters inherently more sensitive to mutations than
	immune genes. Although there have previously been a number of models
	attempting to handle transcription factor binding, Sunflower provides
	a richer biological model, incorporating weak binding sites and the
	possibility of competition. The results show the first clear correlations

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen that infects
	pigs and can occasionally cause serious infections in humans. S.
	suis infections occur sporadically in human Europe and North America,
	but a recent major outbreak has been described in China with high
	levels of mortality. The mechanisms of S. suis pathogenesis in humans
	and pigs are poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The
	sequencing of whole genomes of S. suis isolates provides opportunities
	to investigate the genetic basis of infection. Here we describe whole
	genome sequences of three S. suis strains from the same lineage:
	one from European pigs, and two from human cases from China and Vietnam.
	Comparative genomic analysis was used to investigate the variability
	of these strains. S. suis is phylogenetically distinct from other
	Streptococcus species for which genome sequences are currently available.
	Accordingly, approximately 40\% of the approximately 2 Mb genome
	is unique in comparison to other Streptococcus species. Finer genomic
	comparisons within the species showed a high level of sequence conservation;
	virtually all of the genome is common to the S. suis strains. The
	only exceptions are three approximately 90 kb regions, present in
	the two isolates from humans, composed of integrative conjugative
	elements and transposons. Carried in these regions are coding sequences
	associated with drug resistance. In addition, small-scale sequence
	variation has generated pseudogenes in putative virulence and colonization
	factors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The genomic inventories of genetically
	related S. suis strains, isolated from distinct hosts and diseases,
	exhibit high levels of conservation. However, the genomes provide
	evidence that horizontal gene transfer has contributed to the evolution
	of drug resistance.},

	unique spacer arrangements were observed across the three CRISPR
	loci. Overall, 3,626 spacers were analyzed, including 2,829 for CRISPR1
	(782 unique), 173 for CRISPR2 (16 unique), and 624 for CRISPR3 (154
	unique). Sequence analysis of the spacers revealed homology and identity
	to phage sequences (77\%), plasmid sequences (16\%), and S. thermophilus
	chromosomal sequences (7\%). Polymorphisms were observed for the
	CRISPR repeats, CRISPR spacers, cas genes, CRISPR motif, locus architecture,
	and specific sequence content. Interestingly, CRISPR loci evolved
	both via polarized addition of novel spacers after exposure to foreign
	genetic elements and via internal deletion of spacers. We hypothesize
	that the level of diversity is correlated with relative CRISPR activity
	and propose that the activity is highest for CRISPR1, followed by
	CRISPR3, while CRISPR2 may be degenerate. Globally, the dynamic nature
	of CRISPR loci might prove valuable for typing and comparative analyses
	of strains and microbial populations. Also, CRISPRs provide critical
	insights into the relationships between prokaryotes and their environments,
	notably the coevolution of host and viral genomes.},

	we attempted to determine the causes of the previously reported (Howell
	et al. 2004) violation of the molecular clock during the evolution
	of these sequences. In the coding region, there was a significantly
	higher rate of substitution at synonymous sites than at nonsynonymous
	sites as well as in the tRNA and rRNA genes. This is further evidence
	for the operation of purifying selection during human mtDNA evolution.
	For most sites in the control region, the relative rate of substitution
	was similar to the rate of neutral evolution (assumed to be most
	closely approximated by the substitution rate at 4-fold degenerate
	sites). However, there are a number of mutational hot spots in the
	control region, approximately 3\% of the total sites, that have a
	rate of substitution greater than the neutral rate, at some sites
	by more than an order of magnitude. It is possible either that these
	sites are evolving under conditions of positive selection or that
	the substitution rate at some sites in the control region is strongly
	dependent upon sequence context. Finally, we obtained preliminary
	evidence for "nonideal" evolution in the control region, including
	haplogroup-specific substitution patterns and a decoupling between
	relative rates of substitution in the control and coding regions.},

	599 experimentally verified promoters of E.coli K-12, we generated
	and evaluated more than 200 weight matrices optimizing different
	criteria to obtain the best recognition matrices. The alignments
	generating the best statistical models did not fully correspond with
	the canonical sigma70 model. However, matrices that correspond to
	such a canonical model performed better as tools for prediction.
	We tested the predictive capacity of these matrices on 250 bp long
	regions upstream of gene starts, where 90\% of the known promoters
	occur. The computational matrix models generated an average of 38
	promoter-like signals within each 250 bp region. In more than 50\%
	of the cases, the true promoter does not have the best score within
	the region. We observed, in fact, that real promoters occur mostly
	within regions with high densities of overlapping putative promoters.
	We evaluated several strategies to identify promoters. The best one
	uses an intrinsic score of the -10 and -35 hexamers that form the
	promoter as well as an extrinsic score that uses the distribution
	of promoters from the start of the gene. We were able to identify
	86\% true promoters correctly, generating an average of 4.7 putative
	promoters per region as output, of which 3.7, on average, exist in
	clusters, as a series of overlapping potentially competing RNA polymerase-binding
	sites. As far as we know, this is the highest predictive capability
	reported so far. This high signal density is found mainly within
	regions upstream of genes, contrasting with coding regions and regions
	located between convergently transcribed genes. These results are
	consistent with experimental evidence that show the existence of
	multiple overlapping promoter sites that become functional under
	particular conditions. This density is probably the consequence of
	a rich number of vestiges of promoters in evolution. We suggest that

	that makes use of DNA polymorphism data from a sample of individuals

	approximations to model temporal fluctuations in the selection coefficients
	to find the expected distribution of mutation frequencies in the
	population. Using the Poisson random-field setting we derive the
	site-frequency spectrum (SFS) for three different models of fluctuating
	selection. We find that the general effect of fluctuating selection
	is to produce a more "U"-shaped site-frequency spectrum with an excess
	of high-frequency derived mutations at the expense of middle-frequency
	variants. We present likelihood-ratio tests, comparing the fluctuating
	selection models to the neutral model using SFS data, and use Monte
	Carlo simulations to assess their power. We find that we have sufficient
	power to reject a neutral hypothesis using samples on the order of
	a few hundred SNPs and a sample size of approximately 20 and power
	to distinguish between selection that varies in time and constant
	selection for a sample of size 20. We also find that fluctuating
	selection increases the probability of fixation of selected sites
	even if, on average, there is no difference in selection among a
	pair of alleles segregating at the locus. Fluctuating selection will,
	therefore, lead to an increase in the ratio of divergence to polymorphism
	similar to that observed under positive directional selection.},

	fundamental in studying the evolution of genomes and biological systems.
	To reconstruct plausible evolutionary history, rates of gene gain/loss
	should be estimated by considering the high level of heterogeneity:
	e.g. genome duplication and parasitization, respectively, result
	in high rates of gene gain and loss. Gene-content evolution reconstruction
	methods that consider this heterogeneity and that are both effective
	in estimating the rates of gene gain and loss and sufficiently efficient
	to analyze abundant genomic data had not been developed. RESULTS:
	An effective and efficient method for reconstructing heterogeneous
	gene-content evolution was developed. This method comprises analytically
	integrable modeling of gene-content evolution, analytical formulation
	of expectation-maximization and efficient calculation of marginal
	likelihood using an inside-outside-like algorithm. Simulation tests
	on the scale of hundreds of genomes showed that both the gene gain/loss
	rates and evolutionary history were effectively estimated within
	a few days of computational time. Subsequently, this algorithm was
	applied to an actual data set of nearly 200 genomes to reconstruct
	the heterogeneous gene-content evolution across the three domains
	of life. The reconstructed history, which contained several features
	consistent with biological observations, showed that the trends of
	gene-content evolution were not only drastically different between
	prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but were highly variable within each
	form of life. The results suggest that heterogeneity should be considered
	in studies of the evolution of gene content, genomes and biological
	systems. AVAILABILITY: An R script that implements the algorithm

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In bacteria, sigma factors and other transcriptional regulatory
	proteins recognize DNA patterns upstream of their target genes and

	thought to be enriched in intergenic regions (IRs) and depleted from
	coding regions of prokaryotic genomes. RESULTS: In this work, we
	report that genomic distribution of transcription factors binding

	bacterial species. We further take advantage of this observation
	to develop an algorithm that can efficiently identify promoter boxes
	by a distribution-dependent approach rather than a direct sequence
	comparison approach. This strategy, which can easily be combined
	with other methodologies, allowed the identification of promoter
	sequences in ten species and can be used with any annotated bacterial

	validations of predicted promoters also support our approach. CONCLUSION:
	Considering that complete genomic sequences of over 1000 bacteria

  abstract = {The molecular mechanisms underlying niche adaptation in bacteria are
	not fully understood. Primary infection by the pathogen group A streptococcus
	(GAS) takes place at either the throat or the skin of its human host,
	and GAS strains differ in tissue site preference. Many skin-tropic
	strains bind host plasminogen via the plasminogen-binding group A
	streptococcal M protein (PAM) present on the cell surface; inactivation
	of genes encoding either PAM or streptokinase (a plasminogen activator)
	leads to loss of virulence at the skin. Unlike PAM, which is present
	in only a subset of GAS strains, the gene encoding streptokinase
	(ska) is present in all GAS isolates. In this study, the evolution
	of the virulence genes known to be involved in skin infection was
	examined. Most genetic diversity within ska genes was localized to
	a region encoding the plasminogen-docking domain (beta-domain). The
	gene encoding PAM displayed strong linkage disequilibrium (P << 0.01)
	with a distinct phylogenetic cluster of the ska beta-domain-encoding
	region. Yet, ska alleles of distant taxa showed a history of intragenic
	recombination, and high intrinsic levels of recombination were found
	among GAS strains having different tissue tropisms. The data suggest
	that tissue-specific adaptations arise from epistatic coselection
	of bacterial virulence genes. Additional analysis of ska genes showed
	that approximately 4\% of the codons underwent strong diversifying
	selection. Horizontal acquisition of one ska lineage from a commensal
	Streptococcus donor species was also evident. Together, the data
	suggest that new phenotypes can be acquired through interspecies
	recombination between orthologous genes, while constrained functions
	can be preserved; in this way, orthologous genes may provide a rich
	and ready source for new phenotypes and thereby play a facilitating
	role in the emergence of new niche adaptations in bacteria.},

  year = {2006},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {Article27},
  abstract = {We propose a heuristic approach to the detection of evidence for recombination
	and gene conversion in multiple DNA sequence alignments. The proposed
	method consists of two stages. In the first stage, a sliding window
	is moved along the DNA sequence alignment, and phylogenetic trees
	are sampled from the conditional posterior distribution with MCMC.
	To reduce the noise intrinsic to inference from the limited amount
	of data available in the typically short sliding window, a clustering
	algorithm based on the Robinson-Foulds distance is applied to the
	trees thus sampled, and the posterior distribution over tree clusters
	is obtained for each window position. While changes in this posterior
	distribution are indicative of recombination or gene conversion events,
	it is difficult to decide when such a change is statistically significant.
	This problem is addressed in the second stage of the proposed algorithm,
	where the distributions obtained in the first stage are post-processed
	with a Bayesian hidden Markov model (HMM). The emission states of
	the HMM are associated with posterior distributions over phylogenetic
	tree topology clusters. The hidden states of the HMM indicate putative
	recombinant segments. Inference is done in a Bayesian sense, sampling
	parameters from the posterior distribution with MCMC. Of particular
	interest is the determination of the number of hidden states as an
	indication of the number of putative recombinant regions. To this
	end, we apply reversible jump MCMC, and sample the number of hidden
	states from the respective posterior distribution.},

	seems likely that the lack of conservation and increased rate of

	of natural selection against deleterious mutations because of the

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus is a marine cyanobacterium that numerically dominates
	the mid-latitude oceans and is the smallest known oxygenic phototroph.
	Numerous isolates from diverse areas of the world's oceans have been
	studied and shown to be physiologically and genetically distinct.
	All isolates described thus far can be assigned to either a tightly
	clustered high-light (HL)-adapted clade, or a more divergent low-light
	(LL)-adapted group. The 16S rRNA sequences of the entire Prochlorococcus
	group differ by at most 3\%, and the four initially published genomes
	revealed patterns of genetic differentiation that help explain physiological
	differences among the isolates. Here we describe the genomes of eight
	newly sequenced isolates and combine them with the first four genomes
	for a comprehensive analysis of the core (shared by all isolates)
	and flexible genes of the Prochlorococcus group, and the patterns
	of loss and gain of the flexible genes over the course of evolution.
	There are 1,273 genes that represent the core shared by all 12 genomes.
	They are apparently sufficient, according to metabolic reconstruction,
	to encode a functional cell. We describe a phylogeny for all 12 isolates
	by subjecting their complete proteomes to three different phylogenetic
	analyses. For each non-core gene, we used a maximum parsimony method
	to estimate which ancestor likely first acquired or lost each gene.
	Many of the genetic differences among isolates, especially for genes
	involved in outer membrane synthesis and nutrient transport, are
	found within the same clade. Nevertheless, we identified some genes
	defining HL and LL ecotypes, and clades within these broad ecotypes,
	helping to demonstrate the basis of HL and LL adaptations in Prochlorococcus.
	Furthermore, our estimates of gene gain events allow us to identify
	highly variable genomic islands that are not apparent through simple
	pairwise comparisons. These results emphasize the functional roles,
	especially those connected to outer membrane synthesis and transport
	that dominate the flexible genome and set it apart from the core.
	Besides identifying islands and demonstrating their role throughout
	the history of Prochlorococcus, reconstruction of past gene gains
	and losses shows that much of the variability exists at the "leaves
	of the tree," between the most closely related strains. Finally,
	the identification of core and flexible genes from this 12-genome
	comparison is largely consistent with the relative frequency of Prochlorococcus
	genes found in global ocean metagenomic databases, further closing
	the gap between our understanding of these organisms in the lab and
	the wild.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the continued development of new computational tools
	for multiple sequence alignment, it is necessary today to develop
	benchmarks that aid the selection of the most effective tools. Simulation-based
	benchmarks have been proposed to meet this necessity, especially
	for non-coding sequences. However, it is not clear if such benchmarks
	truly represent real sequence data from any given group of species,
	in terms of the difficulty of alignment tasks. RESULTS: We find that
	the conventional simulation approach, which relies on empirically
	estimated values for various parameters such as substitution rate
	or insertion/deletion rates, is unable to generate synthetic sequences
	reflecting the broad genomic variation in conservation levels. We
	tackle this problem with a new method for simulating non-coding sequence
	evolution, by relying on genome-wide distributions of evolutionary
	parameters rather than their averages. We then generate synthetic
	data sets to mimic orthologous sequences from the Drosophila group
	of species, and show that these data sets truly represent the variability
	observed in genomic data in terms of the difficulty of the alignment
	task. This allows us to make significant progress towards estimating
	the alignment accuracy of current tools in an absolute sense, going
	beyond only a relative assessment of different tools. We evaluate
	six widely used multiple alignment tools in the context of Drosophila
	non-coding sequences, and find the accuracy to be significantly different
	from previously reported values. Interestingly, the performance of
	most tools degrades more rapidly when there are more insertions than
	deletions in the data set, suggesting an asymmetric handling of insertions
	and deletions, even though none of the evaluated tools explicitly
	distinguishes these two types of events. We also examine the accuracy
	of two existing tools for annotating insertions versus deletions,
	and find their performance to be close to optimal in Drosophila non-coding
	sequences if provided with the true alignments. CONCLUSION: We have
	developed a method to generate benchmarks for multiple alignments
	of Drosophila non-coding sequences, and shown it to be more realistic
	than traditional benchmarks. Apart from helping to select the most
	effective tools, these benchmarks will help practitioners of comparative
	genomics deal with the effects of alignment errors, by providing
	accurate estimates of the extent of these errors.},

	gland protein (Acp) genes as our test case. About 700 bp and 600
	bp for the 5' and coding regions, respectively, of eight previously
	unstudied genes were sequenced from 21 isogenic lines of D. melanogaster
	and one line from D. simulans. The ratio of divergence at the amino-acid

	the ratio for common polymorphism. Interestingly, the 5' region shows

	explanations for the 5'/S ratios, including demography, negative

	selection (FDR<0.05), according to a standard likelihood ratio test.
	An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on
	particular lineages or clades. As in previous studies, the identified
	PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception,
	and reproduction, but enrichments were also evident for more specific
	functions, such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception.
	Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible
	co-evolution of interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis of the
	possible "selection histories" of each gene indicated that most PSGs
	have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection,
	suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. A detailed
	analysis of Affymetrix exon array data indicated that PSGs are expressed
	at significantly lower levels, and in a more tissue-specific manner,
	than non-PSGs. Genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen,
	testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but
	no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific
	genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive
	selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into
	the functional implications of positive selection.},

	sequence analysis, the gene content of the FCT region was characterized
	for 113 strains via PCR, and genetic linkage was assessed. A history
	of extensive recombination within FCT regions was evident. The emm
	pattern D-defined skin specialist strains were highly homogenous
	in their FCT region gene contents, whereas the emm pattern A-C-defined
	throat specialist strains displayed a greater variety of forms. Most
	pattern A-C strains harbored prtF1 (75\%) but lacked cpa (75\%).
	In contrast, the majority of emm pattern D strains had cpa (92\%)

	revealed the most parsimonious pathways of evolution. Using niche-determining
	candidate genes to infer phylogeny, emm pattern E strains--the so-called

	a transition zone separating most throat specialists from skin specialists.
	Overall, population genetic analysis supports the possibility that

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The identification of non-coding transcripts in human,
	mouse, and Escherichia coli has revealed their widespread occurrence
	and functional importance in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic life.
	In prokaryotes, studies have shown that non-coding transcripts participate
	in a broad range of cellular functions like gene regulation, stress
	and virulence. However, very little is known about non-coding transcripts
	in Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), an obligate human respiratory
	pathogen responsible for significant worldwide morbidity and mortality.
	Tiling microarrays enable genome wide mRNA profiling as well as identification
	of novel transcripts at a high-resolution. RESULTS: Here, we describe
	a high-resolution transcription map of the S. pneumoniae clinical
	isolate TIGR4 using genomic tiling arrays. Our results indicate that
	approximately 66\% of the genome is expressed under our experimental
	conditions. We identified a total of 50 non-coding small RNAs (sRNAs)
	from the intergenic regions, of which 36 had no predicted function.
	Half of the identified sRNA sequences were found to be unique to
	S. pneumoniae genome. We identified eight overrepresented sequence
	motifs among sRNA sequences that correspond to sRNAs in different
	functional categories. Tiling arrays also identified approximately
	202 operon structures in the genome. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the
	pneumococcal operon structures and novel sRNAs identified in this
	study enhance our understanding of the complexity and extent of the
	pneumococcal 'expressed' genome. Furthermore, the results of this
	study open up new avenues of research for understanding the complex

	fashion-the support in favor of clades with similar or identical
	genome arrangements is considered to be quite strong, but is not
	quantified. The purpose of this article is to quantify the uncertainty
	among the relationships of metazoan phyla on the basis of mitochondrial
	genome arrangements while incorporating prior knowledge of the monophyly
	of various groups from other sources. The work we present here differs
	from our previous work in the statistics literature in that (1) we
	incorporate prior information on classifications of metazoans at
	the phylum level, (2) we describe several advances in our computational
	approach, and (3) we analyze a much larger data set (87 taxa) that
	consists of each unique, complete mitochondrial genome arrangement
	with a full complement of 37 genes that were present in the NCBI
	(National Center for Biotechnology Information) database at a recent
	date. In addition, we analyze a subset of 28 of these 87 taxa for
	which the non-tRNA mitochondrial genomes are unique where the assumption
	of our inversion-only model of rearrangement is more plausible. We
	present summaries of Bayesian posterior distributions of tree topology
	on the basis of these two data sets.},

	Bayesian species delimitation uses reversible-jump Markov chain Monte

	delimitation to investigate the speciation history of forest geckos

	for the number of species in this complex. We examine the impact
	of the guide tree, and the prior distributions on ancestral population
	sizes () and root age (τ(0)), on the posterior probabilities for
	species delimitation. Mis-specification of the guide tree or the

	of the core genome plays in diversification and adaptation of bacterial
	species, and how this might differ between groups of bacteria occupying

	several important human and animal enteric pathogens, with genome

	the same gene frequently under positive selection in multiple lineages.
	Tests are provided that reject recombination, saturation, and variation
	in codon usage bias as factors contributing to this high level of

	from a Red Queen macroevolutionary dynamic, in which species are
	involved in competition for resources within the mammalian and/or
	vertebrate gastrointestinal tract. Much reduced levels of positive
	selection evident in Streptococcus, as reported by the authors in
	an earlier work, may be a consequence of these taxa inhabiting less

	these results describe the diversification of a bacterial genus that
	involves pervasive natural selection pressure across virtually the
	entire genome, with this adaptation occurring in different ways in
	different lineages, despite the species tendency toward a common

	pyogenes. Core-genome recombination was evident in all lineages (18\%
	to 37\% of the core-genome judged to be recombinant), while positive
	selection was mainly observed during species differentiation (from
	11\% to 34\% of the core-genome). Positive selection pressure was

	S. suis was the lineage with the greatest level of positive selection

	Positive selection, although undoubtedly a slower process, has nonetheless

	RESULTS: We introduce a class of string kernels, called mismatch

	approach to the problem of protein classification and remote homology
	detection. These kernels measure sequence similarity based on shared

	efficiently using a mismatch tree data structure, allowing us to
	calculate the contributions of all patterns occurring in the data
	in one pass while traversing the tree. When used with an SVM, the
	kernels enable fast prediction on test sequences. We report experiments

  abstract = {The identification of orthologous groups is useful for genome annotation,
	studies on gene/protein evolution, comparative genomics, and the
	identification of taxonomically restricted sequences. Methods successfully
	exploited for prokaryotic genome analysis have proved difficult to
	apply to eukaryotes, however, as larger genomes may contain multiple
	paralogous genes, and sequence information is often incomplete. OrthoMCL
	provides a scalable method for constructing orthologous groups across
	multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to group
	(putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly
	to the INPARANOID algorithm when applied to two genomes, but can
	be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL
	clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved
	recognition of "recent" paralogs permits overlapping EGO groups representing
	the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC
	annotations suggests a high degree of reliability, implying utility
	for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been applied
	to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human,
	fly, worm, yeast, Arabidopsis, the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum,
	and Escherichia coli). A Web interface allows queries based on individual
	genes or user-defined phylogenetic patterns (http://www.cbil.upenn.edu/gene-family).
	Analysis of clusters incorporating P. falciparum genes identifies
	numerous enzymes that were incompletely annotated in first-pass annotation

  abstract = {How often micro-RNA (miRNA) genes emerged and how fast they evolved
	soon after their emergence are some of the central questions in the
	evolution of miRNAs. Because most known miRNA genes are ancient and
	highly conserved, these questions can be best answered by identifying
	newly emerged miRNA genes. Among the 78 miRNA genes in Drosophila
	reported before 2007, only 5 are confirmed to be newly emerged in
	the genus (although many more can be found in the newly reported
	data set; e.g., Ruby et al. 2007; Stark et al. 2007; Lu et al. 2008).
	These new miRNA genes have undergone numerous changes, even in the
	normally invariant mature sequences. Four of them (the miR-310/311/312/313
	cluster, denoted miR-310s) were duplicated from other conserved miRNA
	genes. The fifth one (miR-303) appears to be a very young gene, originating
	de novo from a non-miRNA sequence recently. We sequenced these 5
	miRNA genes and their neighboring regions from a worldwide collection
	of Drosophila melanogaster lines. The levels of divergence and polymorphism
	in these miRNA genes, vis-à-vis those of the neighboring DNA sequences,
	suggest that these 5 genes are evolving adaptively. Furthermore,
	the polymorphism pattern of miR-310s in D. melanogaster is indicative
	of hitchhiking under positive selection. Thus, a large number of
	adaptive changes over a long period of time may be essential for
	the evolution of newly emerged miRNA genes.},

	RESULTS: Simulations suggest that new method for estimating indel

	show that indel rates are up to twice higher than is apparent from
	alignments, and depend strongly on the local G + C content. These
	results indicate that at these evolutionary distances, the contribution
	of indels to sequence divergence is much larger than hitherto appreciated.
	In particular, the ratio of substitution to indel rates between human

	estimates. Here, we report on a theoretical and simulation study
	of pairwise alignments of genomic DNA at human-mouse divergence.
	We find that >15\% of aligned bases are incorrect in existing whole-genome
	alignments, and we identify three types of alignment error, each
	leading to systematic biases in all algorithms considered. Careful
	modeling of the evolutionary process improves alignment quality;
	however, these improvements are modest compared with the remaining
	alignment errors, even with exact knowledge of the evolutionary model,
	emphasizing the need for statistical approaches to account for uncertainty.
	We develop a new algorithm, Marginalized Posterior Decoding (MPD),
	which explicitly accounts for uncertainties, is less biased and more
	accurate than other algorithms we consider, and reduces the proportion
	of misaligned bases by a third compared with the best existing algorithm.
	To our knowledge, this is the first nonheuristic algorithm for DNA
	sequence alignment to show robust improvements over the classic Needleman-Wunsch
	algorithm. Despite this, considerable uncertainty remains even in
	the improved alignments. We conclude that a probabilistic treatment
	is essential, both to improve alignment quality and to quantify the
	remaining uncertainty. This is becoming increasingly relevant with
	the growing appreciation of the importance of noncoding DNA, whose
	study relies heavily on alignments. Alignment errors are inevitable,

  abstract = {Unlike the situation in prokaryotes, most eukaryotic messenger RNAs
	contain a moderately long 5' untranslated region (UTR). Such leader
	sequences impose a burden on eukaryotic genes by providing substrate
	for the mutational origin of premature translation-initiation codons,
	which generally result in defective proteins. To gain an insight
	into the expansion of 5' UTRs in eukaryotic genomes, we present a
	simple null model in which the evolution of transcription-initiation
	sites is entirely driven by the stochastic mutational flux of core-promoter
	sequences and premature translation-initiation codons. This model
	yields results consistent with a variety of heretofore disconnected
	observations, including the form of length distributions of 5' UTRs,
	the relatively low variance in UTR features among distantly related
	eukaryotes, the universal reliance on relatively simple core-promoter
	sequences, and the elevated density of introns in the 5' UTR. We
	suggest that the reduced effective population sizes of most eukaryotes
	impose a population-genetic environment conducive to the movement
	of core promoters to random positions, subject to the constraint
	imposed by the upstream accumulation of premature translation-initiation
	codons. If this hypothesis is correct, then selection for gene-specific
	regulatory features need not be invoked to explain either the origin
	of lengthy eukaryotic 5' UTRs or the 1,000-fold range of 5'-UTR lengths
	among genes within species. Nevertheless, once permanently established,
	expanded 5' UTRs may have provided a novel substrate for the evolution
	of mechanisms for posttranscriptional regulation of eukaryotic gene
	expression. These results provide a further example of how an increase
	in the power of random genetic drift can passively promote the evolution
	of forms of gene architecture that ultimately facilitate the evolution
	of organismal complexity.},

	with the extent of DNA sequence divergence between the donor and

	Here we demonstrate that sexual isolation in transformation between
	Streptococcus pneumoniae recipient strains and donor DNA from related

	We show that the Hex mismatch repair system poses a significant barrier

	saturated, it is responsible for 34\% of the observed sexual isolation.
	This is greater than the role of mismatch repair in Bacillus but
	less than that in Escherichia. The remaining non-Hex-mediated barrier

	without inducing autoimmunity. Clustered, regularly interspaced,

	pathway. CRISPR loci are present in approximately 40\% and approximately
	90\% of sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes, respectively, and
	evolve rapidly, acquiring new spacer sequences to adapt to highly
	dynamic viral populations. Immunity requires a sequence match between
	the invasive DNA and the spacers that lie between CRISPR repeats.
	Each cluster is genetically linked to a subset of the cas (CRISPR-associated)
	genes that collectively encode >40 families of proteins involved
	in adaptation and interference. CRISPR loci encode small CRISPR RNAs
	(crRNAs) that contain a full spacer flanked by partial repeat sequences.
	CrRNA spacers are thought to identify targets by direct Watson-Crick
	pairing with invasive 'protospacer' DNA, but how they avoid targeting
	the spacer DNA within the encoding CRISPR locus itself is unknown.
	Here we have defined the mechanism of CRISPR self/non-self discrimination.
	In Staphylococcus epidermidis, target/crRNA mismatches at specific
	positions outside of the spacer sequence license foreign DNA for
	interference, whereas extended pairing between crRNA and CRISPR DNA
	repeats prevents autoimmunity. Hence, this CRISPR system uses the
	base-pairing potential of crRNAs not only to specify a target, but
	also to spare the bacterial chromosome from interference. Differential
	complementarity outside of the spacer sequence is a built-in feature
	of all CRISPR systems, indicating that this mechanism is a broadly

	for regulatory motifs using the program AlignACE together with a
	set of filters that helped us choose the motifs most likely to be

	the upstream regions of potentially coregulated genes grouped by
	three methods: (1) genes that make up functional pathways; (2) genes
	homologous to regulons from a well-studied species (Escherichia coli);
	and (3) groups of genes derived from conserved operons. This last
	group is based on the observation that genes making up homologous
	regulons in different species are often assorted into coregulated
	operons in different combinations. This allows partial reconstruction
	of regulons by looking at operon structure across several species.
	Unlike other methods for predicting regulons, this method does not
	depend on the availability of experimental data other than the genome
	sequence and the locations of genes. New, statistically significant
	motifs were found in the genome sequence of each organism using each
	grouping method. The most significant new motif was found upstream

	thermoautotrophicum. We found that at least 27\% of the known E.
	coli DNA-regulatory motifs are conserved in one or more distantly

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis (SDSE)
	is an emerging global pathogen that can colonize and infect humans.
	Although most SDSE isolates possess the Lancefield group G carbohydrate,
	a significant minority have the group C carbohydrate. Isolates are
	further sub-typed on the basis of differences within the emm gene.
	To gain a better understanding of their molecular epidemiology and
	evolutionary relationships, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis
	was performed on SDSE isolates collected from Australia, Europe and
	North America. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The 178 SDSE isolates,
	representing 37 emm types, segregate into 80 distinct sequence types
	(STs) that form 17 clonal complexes (CCs). Eight STs recovered from
	all three continents account for >50\% of the isolates. Thus, a small
	number of STs are highly prevalent and have a wide geographic distribution.
	Both ST and CC strongly correlate with group carbohydrate. In contrast,
	eleven STs were associated with >1 emm type, suggestive of recombinational
	replacements involving the emm gene; furthermore, 35\% of the emm
	types are associated with genetically distant STs. Data also reveal
	a history of extensive inter- and intra-species recombination involving
	the housekeeping genes used for MLST. Sequence analysis of single
	locus variants identified through goeBURST indicates that genetic
	change mediated by recombination occurred approximately 4.4 times
	more frequently than by point mutation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
	A few genetic lineages with an intercontinental distribution dominate
	among SDSE causing infections in humans. The distinction between
	group C and G isolates reflects recent evolution, and no long-term
	genetic isolation between them was found. Lateral gene transfer and
	recombination involving housekeeping genes and the emm gene are important
	mechanisms driving genetic variability in the SDSE population.},

  abstract = {The 1,815,783-bp genome of a serotype M49 strain of Streptococcus
	pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]), strain NZ131, has been determined.
	This GAS strain (FCT type 3; emm pattern E), originally isolated
	from a case of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, is unusually
	competent for electrotransformation and has been used extensively
	as a model organism for both basic genetic and pathogenesis investigations.
	As with the previously sequenced S. pyogenes genomes, three unique
	prophages are a major source of genetic diversity. Two clustered
	regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) regions were
	present in the genome, providing genetic information on previous
	prophage encounters. A unique cluster of genes was found in the pathogenicity
	island-like emm region that included a novel Nudix hydrolase, and,
	further, this cluster appears to be specific for serotype M49 and
	M82 strains. Nudix hydrolases eliminate potentially hazardous materials
	or prevent the unbalanced accumulation of normal metabolites; in
	bacteria, these enzymes may play a role in host cell invasion. Since
	M49 S. pyogenes strains have been known to be associated with skin
	infections, the Nudix hydrolase and its associated genes may have
	a role in facilitating survival in an environment that is more variable
	and unpredictable than the uniform warmth and moisture of the throat.
	The genome of NZ131 continues to shed light upon the evolutionary
	history of this human pathogen. Apparent horizontal transfer of genetic
	material has led to the existence of highly variable virulence-associated
	regions that are marked by multiple rearrangements and genetic diversification
	while other regions, even those associated with virulence, vary little
	between genomes. The genome regions that encode surface gene products
	that will interact with host targets or aid in immune avoidance are
	the ones that display the most sequence diversity. Thus, while natural
	selection favors stability in much of the genome, it favors diversity

	for obtaining the inversion distance of two signed permutations,
	there is no reliable algorithm when both inversions and transpositions

	different rates, and it is not clear how to weight them in a distance

	dual MCP model is an extension of the model introduced previously

	change-point process is used to model spatial phylogenetic variation.
	Here, we show that using two change-point processes, one for spatial
	variation of tree topologies and the other for spatial variation
	of substitution process parameters, increases recombination detection
	accuracy. Statistical analysis is done in a Bayesian framework using
	reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to approximate
	the joint posterior distribution of all model parameters. RESULTS:
	We use primate mitochondrial DNA data with simulated recombination
	break-points at specific locations to compare the two models. We
	also analyze two real HIV sequences to identify recombination break-points
	using the dual MCP model.},

	of a negative feedback loop distinguishes the CovR/S system from
	the majority of bacterial two-component systems. We developed a deterministic
	model of the CovR/S system consisting of eight delay differential
	equations. Computational experiments showed that the system possessed
	a unique stable steady state. The dynamical behavior of the system
	showed a tendency for oscillations becoming more pronounced for longer
	but still biochemically realistic delays resulting from reductions
	in the rates of translation elongation. We have devised an efficient
	procedure for computing the system's steady state. Further, we have
	shown that the signal-response curves are hyperbolic for the default
	parameter values. However, in experiments with randomized parameters
	we demonstrated that sigmoidality of signal-response curves, implying
	a response threshold, is not only possible, but seems to be rather
	typical for CovR/S-like systems even when binding of the CovR response
	regulator protein to a promoter is non-cooperative. We used sensitivity
	analysis to simplify the model in order to make it analytically tractable.
	The existence and uniqueness of the steady state and hyperbolicity
	of signal-response curves for the majority of the variables was proved
	for the simplified model. Also, we found that provided CovS was active,
	the system was insensitive to changes in the concentration of any
	other phosphoryl donor such as acetyl phosphate.},

	purifying selection at noncoding positions in clades of related bacterial
	genomes. We comprehensively quantified evidence of purifying selection
	at noncoding positions across bacteria and found several striking
	universal patterns. Consistent with selection acting at transcriptional
	regulatory elements near the transcription start, we find a universal
	positional profile of selection with respect to gene starts and ends,
	showing most evidence of selection immediately upstream and least
	immediately downstream from genes. A further set of universal features
	indicates that selection for translation initiation efficiency is
	the major determinant of the sequence composition around translation
	start in all clades. In addition to a peak in selection at ribosomal
	binding sites, the region immediately around translation start shows
	a universal pattern of high adenine frequency, significant selection
	at silent positions, and avoidance of RNA secondary structure. Surprisingly,
	although the number of transcription factors (TF) increases quadratically
	with genome size, we present several lines of evidence that small
	and large genomes have the same average number of regulatory sites
	per intergenic region. By comparing the sequence diversity of the
	most and least conserved DNA words in intergenic regions across clades
	we provide evidence that the structure of transcription regulatory

  year = {2009},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {286},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although cis-regulatory changes play an important role
	in evolution, it remains difficult to establish the contribution
	of natural selection to regulatory differences between species. For
	protein coding regions, powerful tests of natural selection have
	been developed based on comparisons of synonymous and non-synonymous
	substitutions, and analogous tests for regulatory regions would be
	of great utility. RESULTS: Here, tests for natural selection on regulatory
	regions are proposed based on nucleotide substitutions that occur
	in characterized transcription factor binding sites (an important
	type functional element within regulatory regions). In the absence
	of selection, these substitutions will tend to reduce the strength
	of existing binding sites. On the other hand, purifying selection
	will act to preserve the binding sites in regulatory regions, while
	positive selection can act to create or destroy binding sites, as
	well as change their strength. Using standard models of binding site
	strength and molecular evolution in the absence of selection, this
	intuition can be used to develop statistical tests for natural selection.
	Application of these tests to two well-characterized regulatory regions
	in Drosophila provides evidence for purifying selection. CONCLUSION:
	This demonstrates that it is possible to develop tests for selection
	on regulatory regions based on the specific functional constrains
	on these sequences.},

	controlling phenotypic characters expressed in the early stage of
	development are highly conserved and that recent evolutionary changes

	are generally conserved, but there is a large component of neutral
	or nearly neutral genetic variation within and between closely related
	species. Phenotypic evolution occurs primarily by mutation of genes
	that interact with one another in the developmental process. The
	enormous amount of phenotypic diversity among different phyla or
	classes of organisms is a product of accumulation of novel mutations
	and their conservation that have facilitated adaptation to different
	environments. Novel mutations may be incorporated into the genome
	by natural selection (elimination of preexisting genotypes) or by
	random processes such as genetic and genomic drift. However, once
	the mutations are incorporated into the genome, they may generate
	developmental constraints that will affect the future direction of
	phenotypic evolution. It appears that the driving force of phenotypic
	evolution is mutation, and natural selection is of secondary importance.},

  abstract = {The relative contributions of natural selection and random genetic
	drift are a major source of debate in the study of gene expression
	evolution, which is hypothesized to serve as a bridge from molecular
	to phenotypic evolution. It has been suggested that the conflict
	between views is caused by the lack of a definite model of the neutral
	hypothesis, which can describe the long-run behavior of evolutionary
	change in mRNA abundance. Therefore previous studies have used inadequate
	analogies with the neutral prediction of other phenomena, such as
	amino acid or nucleotide sequence evolution, as the null hypothesis
	of their statistical inference.In this study, we introduced two novel
	theoretical models, one based on neutral drift and the other assuming
	natural selection, by focusing on a common property of the distribution
	of mRNA abundance among a variety of eukaryotic cells, which reflects
	the result of long-term evolution. Our results demonstrated that
	(1) our models can reproduce two independently found phenomena simultaneously:
	the time development of gene expression divergence and Zipf's law
	of the transcriptome; (2) cytological constraints can be explicitly
	formulated to describe long-term evolution; (3) the model assuming
	that natural selection optimized relative mRNA abundance was more
	consistent with previously published observations than the model
	of optimized absolute mRNA abundances.The models introduced in this
	study give a formulation of evolutionary change in the mRNA abundance
	of each gene as a stochastic process, on the basis of previously
	published observations. This model provides a foundation for interpreting
	observed data in studies of gene expression evolution, including
	identifying an adequate time scale for discriminating the effect

  pages = {85--98},
  abstract = {A major mode of gene expression evolution is based on changes in cis-regulatory
	elements (CREs) whose function critically depends on the presence
	of transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS). Because CREs experience
	extensive TFBS turnover even with conserved function, alignment-based
	studies of CRE sequence evolution are limited to very closely related
	species. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on a stochastic
	model of TFBS turnover. We implemented a maximum likelihood model
	that permits variable turnover rates in different parts of the species
	tree. This model can be used to detect changes in turnover rate as
	a proxy for differences in the selective pressures acting on TFBS
	in different clades. We applied this method to five TFBS in the fungi
	methionine biosynthesis pathway and three TFBS in the HoxA clusters
	of vertebrates. We find that the estimated turnover rate is generally
	high, with half-life ranging between approximately 5 and 150 My and
	a mode around tens of millions of years. This rate is consistent
	with the finding that even functionally conserved enhancers can show
	very low sequence similarity. We also detect statistically significant
	differences in the equilibrium densities of estrogen- and progesterone-response
	elements in the HoxA clusters between mammal and nonmammal vertebrates.
	Even more extreme clade-specific differences were found in the fungal
	data. We conclude that stochastic models of TFBS turnover enable
	the detection of shifts in the selective pressures acting on CREs
	in different organisms. The analysis tool, called CRETO (Cis-Regulatory

	for predicting metabolic pathways in sequenced genomes, and to understand
	the contributions of both the prediction algorithms, and the reference
	pathway databases used by those algorithms, to the prediction accuracy.
	RESULTS: The comparisons we performed were as follows. (1) We compared
	two predictions of the pathway complements of Helicobacter pylori
	that were computed by an early version of our pathway-prediction
	algorithm: prediction A used the EcoCyc E. coli pathway DB as the
	reference database (DB) for prediction, and prediction B used the
	MetaCyc pathway DB (a superset of EcoCyc) as the reference pathway
	DB. The MetaCyc-based prediction contained 75\% more pathway predictions,
	but we believe a significant number of those predictions were false
	positives. (2) We compared two predictions of the pathway complement
	of H. pylori that used MetaCyc as the reference pathway DB, but that
	used different algorithms: the original PathoLogic algorithm, and
	an enhanced version of the algorithm designed to eliminate false-positive
	pathway predictions. The improved algorithm predicted 30\\% fewer
	metabolic pathways than the original algorithm; all of the eliminated
	pathways are believed to be false-positive predictions. (3) We compared
	the 98 pathways predicted by the enhanced algorithm with the results
	of a manual analysis of the pathways of H. pylori. Results: 40 of
	the computationally predicted pathways were consistent with the manual
	analysis, 13 pathways are considered false-positive predictions,
	and four pathways had partially overlapping topologies. Twenty-six
	predicted pathways were not mentioned in the manual analysis; we
	believe these are correct predictions by PathoLogic that were not
	found by the manual analysis. Five pathways from the manual analysis
	were not found computationally. Agreement between the computational
	and manual predictions was good overall, with the computational analysis
	inferring many pathways that the manual analysis did not identify.
	Ultimately the manual analysis is also partially speculative, and
	therefore is not an absolute measure of correctness. The algorithm
	is designed to err on the side of more false positives to bring more
	potential pathways to the user's attention. The resulting H. pylori
	pathway DB is freely available at http://ecocyc.org:1555/HPY/organism-summary?object=HPY.

  abstract = {The multilocus conditional sampling distribution (CSD) describes the
	probability that an additionally sampled DNA sequence is of a certain
	type, given that a collection of sequences has already been observed.
	The CSD has a wide range of applications in both computational biology
	and population genomics analysis, including phasing genotype data
	into haplotype data, imputing missing data, estimating recombination
	rates, inferring local ancestry in admixed populations, and importance
	sampling of coalescent genealogies. Unfortunately, the true CSD under
	the coalescent with recombination is not known, so approximations,
	formulated as hidden Markov models, have been proposed in the past.
	These approximations have led to a number of useful statistical tools,
	but it is important to recognize that they were not derived from,
	though were certainly motivated by, principles underlying the coalescent
	process. The goal of this article is to develop a principled approach
	to derive improved CSDs directly from the underlying population genetics
	model. Our approach is based on the diffusion process approximation
	and the resulting mathematical expressions admit intuitive genealogical
	interpretations, which we utilize to introduce further approximations
	and make our method scalable in the number of loci. The general algorithm

  abstract = {Identifying the sequences that direct the spatial and temporal expression
	of genes and defining their function in vivo remains a significant
	challenge in the annotation of vertebrate genomes. One major obstacle
	is the lack of experimentally validated training sets. In this study,
	we made use of extreme evolutionary sequence conservation as a filter
	to identify putative gene regulatory elements, and characterized
	the in vivo enhancer activity of a large group of non-coding elements
	in the human genome that are conserved in human-pufferfish, Takifugu
	(Fugu) rubripes, or ultraconserved in human-mouse-rat. We tested
	167 of these extremely conserved sequences in a transgenic mouse
	enhancer assay. Here we report that 45\% of these sequences functioned
	reproducibly as tissue-specific enhancers of gene expression at embryonic
	day 11.5. While directing expression in a broad range of anatomical
	structures in the embryo, the majority of the 75 enhancers directed
	expression to various regions of the developing nervous system. We
	identified sequence signatures enriched in a subset of these elements
	that targeted forebrain expression, and used these features to rank
	all approximately 3,100 non-coding elements in the human genome that
	are conserved between human and Fugu. The testing of the top predictions
	in transgenic mice resulted in a threefold enrichment for sequences
	with forebrain enhancer activity. These data dramatically expand
	the catalogue of human gene enhancers that have been characterized
	in vivo, and illustrate the utility of such training sets for a variety
	of biological applications, including decoding the regulatory vocabulary
	of the human genome.},

	Statistical analyses of extant M. tuberculosis minisatellite data
	are consistent with Quebec as a source population for M. tuberculosis
	gene flow into Aboriginal populations during the fur trade era. Historical
	and genetic analyses suggest that tiny M. tuberculosis populations
	persisted for ∼100 y among indigenous populations and subsequently
	expanded in the late 19th century after environmental changes favoring
	the pathogen. Our study suggests that spread of TB can occur by two
	asynchronous processes: (i) dispersal of M. tuberculosis by minimal
	numbers of human migrants, during which small pathogen populations
	are sustained by ongoing migration and slow disease dynamics, and
	(ii) expansion of the M. tuberculosis population facilitated by shifts
	in host ecology. If generalizable, these migration dynamics can help
	explain the low DNA sequence diversity observed among isolates of
	M. tuberculosis and the difficulties in global elimination of tuberculosis,
	as small, widely dispersed pathogen populations are difficult both

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Predicting cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in higher eukaryotes
	is a challenging computational task. Commonly used methods to predict
	CRMs based on the signal of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS)
	are limited by prior information about transcription factor specificity.
	More general methods that bypass the reliance on TFBS models are
	needed for comprehensive CRM prediction. RESULTS: We have developed
	a method to predict CRMs called CisPlusFinder that identifies high
	density regions of perfect local ungapped sequences (PLUSs) based
	on multiple species conservation. By assuming that PLUSs contain
	core TFBS motifs that are locally overrepresented, the method attempts
	to capture the expected features of CRM structure and evolution.
	Applied to a benchmark dataset of CRMs involved in early Drosophila
	development, CisPlusFinder predicts more annotated CRMs than all
	other methods tested. Using the REDfly database, we find that some
	'false positive' predictions in the benchmark dataset correspond
	to recently annotated CRMs. Our work demonstrates that CRM prediction
	methods that combine comparative genomic data with statistical properties
	of DNA may achieve reasonable performance when applied genome-wide
	in the absence of an a priori set of known TFBS motifs. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {Methods for detecting nucleotide substitution rates that are faster
	or slower than expected under neutral drift are widely used to identify
	candidate functional elements in genomic sequences. However, most
	existing methods consider either reductions (conservation) or increases
	(acceleration) in rate but not both, or assume that selection acts
	uniformly across the branches of a phylogeny. Here we examine the
	more general problem of detecting departures from the neutral rate
	of substitution in either direction, possibly in a clade-specific
	manner. We consider four statistical, phylogenetic tests for addressing
	this problem: a likelihood ratio test, a score test, a test based
	on exact distributions of numbers of substitutions, and the genomic
	evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) test. All four tests have been
	implemented in a freely available program called phyloP. Based on
	extensive simulation experiments, these tests are remarkably similar
	in statistical power. With 36 mammalian species, they all appear
	to be capable of fairly good sensitivity with low false-positive
	rates in detecting strong selection at individual nucleotides, moderate
	selection in 3-bp elements, and weaker or clade-specific selection
	in longer elements. By applying phyloP to mammalian multiple alignments
	from the ENCODE project, we shed light on patterns of conservation/acceleration
	in known and predicted functional elements, approximate fractions
	of sites subject to constraint, and differences in clade-specific
	selection in the primate and glires clades. We also describe new
	"Conservation" tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser that display both

  abstract = {Model selection is a topic of special relevance in molecular phylogenetics
	that affects many, if not all, stages of phylogenetic inference.
	Here we discuss some fundamental concepts and techniques of model
	selection in the context of phylogenetics. We start by reviewing
	different aspects of the selection of substitution models in phylogenetics
	from a theoretical, philosophical and practical point of view, and
	summarize this comparison in table format. We argue that the most
	commonly implemented model selection approach, the hierarchical likelihood
	ratio test, is not the optimal strategy for model selection in phylogenetics,
	and that approaches like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and
	Bayesian methods offer important advantages. In particular, the latter
	two methods are able to simultaneously compare multiple nested or
	nonnested models, assess model selection uncertainty, and allow for
	the estimation of phylogenies and model parameters using all available
	models (model-averaged inference or multimodel inference). We also
	describe how the relative importance of the different parameters
	included in substitution models can be depicted. To illustrate some
	of these points, we have applied AIC-based model averaging to 37
	mitochondrial DNA sequences from the subgenus Ohomopterus(genus Carabus)

  abstract = {Perhaps the most-surprising discovery of the genome era has been the
	extent to which prokaryotic and many eukaryotic genomes incorporate
	genetic material from sources other than their parent(s). Lateral
	genetic transfer (LGT) among bacteria was first observed about 100
	years ago, and is now accepted to underlie important phenomena including
	the spread of antibiotic resistance and ability to degrade xenobiotics.
	LGT is invoked, perhaps too readily, to explain a breadth of awkward
	data including compositional heterogeneity of genomes, disagreement
	among gene-sequence trees, and mismatch between physiology and systematics.
	At the same time many details of LGT remain unknown or controversial,
	and some key questions have scarcely been asked. Here I critically
	review what we think we know about the existence, extent, mechanism
	and impact of LGT; identify important open questions; and point to
	research directions that hold particular promise for elucidating
	the role of LGT in genome evolution. Evidence for LGT in nature is
	not only inferential but also direct, and potential vectors are ubiquitous.
	Genetic material can pass between diverse habitats and be significantly
	altered during residency in viruses, complicating the inference of
	donors, In prokaryotes about twice as many genes are interrupted
	by LGT as are transferred intact, and about 5Short protein domains
	can be privileged units of transfer. Unresolved phylogenetic issues
	include the correct null hypothesis, and genes as units of analysis.
	Themes are beginning to emerge regarding the effect of LGT on cellular
	networks, but I show why generalization is premature. LGT can associate
	with radical changes in physiology and ecological niche. Better quantitative
	models of genome evolution are needed, and theoretical frameworks
	remain to be developed for some observations including chromosome

	edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential
	expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model
	is used to account for both biological and technical variability.
	Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion
	across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology
	can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided
	at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The
	software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such
	as proteome peptide count data. AVAILABILITY: The package is freely

  title = {On origin of genetic code and tRNA before translation.},
  journal = {Biol Direct},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {14},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT:Synthesis of proteins is based on the genetic code - a nearly
	universal assignment of codons to amino acids (aas). A major challenge
	to the understanding of the origins of this assignment is the archetypal
	"key-lock vs. frozen accident" dilemma. Here we re-examine this dilemma
	in light of 1) the fundamental veto on "foresight evolution", 2)
	modular structures of tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and 3)
	the updated library of aa-binding sites in RNA aptamers successfully
	selected in vitro for eight amino acids.The aa-binding sites of arginine,
	isoleucine and tyrosine contain both their cognate triplets, anticodons
	and codons. We have noticed that these cases might be associated
	with palindrome-dinucleotides. For example, one-base shift to the
	left brings arginine codons CGN, with CG at 1-2 positions, to the
	respective anticodons NCG, with CG at 2-3 positions. Formally, the
	concomitant presence of codons and anticodons is also expected in
	the reverse situation, with codons containing palindrome-dinucleotides
	at their 2-3 positions, and anticodons exhibiting them at 1-2 positions.
	A closer analysis reveals that, surprisingly, RNA binding sites for
	Arg, Ile and Tyr "prefer" (exactly as in the actual genetic code)
	the anticodon(2-3)/codon(1-2) tetramers to their anticodon(1-2)/codon(2-3)
	counterparts, despite the seemingly perfect symmetry of the latter.
	However, since in vitro selection of aa-specific RNA aptamers apparently
	had nothing to do with translation, this striking preference provides
	a new strong support to the notion of the genetic code emerging before
	translation, in response to catalytic (and possibly other) needs
	of ancient RNA life. Consistently with the pre-translation origin
	of the code, we propose here a new model of tRNA origin by the gradual,
	Fibonacci process-like, elongation of a tRNA molecule from a primordial
	coding triplet and 5'DCCA3' quadruplet (D is a base-determinator)
	to the eventual 76 base-long cloverleaf-shaped molecule.Taken together,
	our findings necessarily imply that primordial tRNAs, tRNA aminoacylating
	ribozymes, and (later) the translation machinery in general have
	been co-evolving to ''fit'' the (likely already defined) genetic
	code, rather than the opposite way around. Coding triplets in this
	primal pre-translational code were likely similar to the anticodons,
	with second and third nucleotides being more important than the less
	specific first one. Later, when the code was expanding in co-evolution
	with the translation apparatus, the importance of 2-3 nucleotides
	of coding triplets "transferred" to the 1-2 nucleotides of their
	complements, thus distinguishing anticodons from codons. This evolutionary
	primacy of anticodons in genetic coding makes the hypothesis of primal
	stereo-chemical affinity between amino acids and cognate triplets,
	the hypothesis of coding coenzyme handles for amino acids, the hypothesis
	of tRNA-like genomic 3' tags suggesting that tRNAs originated in
	replication, and the hypothesis of ancient ribozymes-mediated operational
	code of tRNA aminoacylation not mutually contradicting but rather
	co-existing in harmony.This article was reviewed by Eugene V. Koonin,

	is one way of estimating these probabilities. Here, we combine these
	two ideas for the first time to construct maximal expected accuracy
	sequence alignments. RESULTS: We bridge the two techniques within
	the program Probalign. Our results indicate that Probalign alignments
	are generally more accurate than other leading multiple sequence
	alignment methods (i.e. Probcons, MAFFT and MUSCLE) on the BAliBASE
	3.0 protein alignment benchmark. Similarly, Probalign also outperforms
	these methods on the HOMSTRAD and OXBENCH benchmarks. Probalign ranks
	statistically highest (P-value < 0.005) on all three benchmarks.
	Deeper scrutiny of the technique indicates that the improvements
	are largest on datasets containing N/C-terminal extensions and on
	datasets containing long and heterogeneous length proteins. These
	points are demonstrated on both real and simulated data. Finally,
	our method also produces accurate alignments on long and heterogeneous

	scores are at least 10\% and 15\% higher than the other three methods

	for identifying putative functional elements in silico. The availability

	in the development of popular tools, for example, the phastCons software

	elements. While phastCons can analyze many genomes simultaneously,
	it ignores potentially informative insertion and deletion events
	and relies on a fixed, precomputed multiple sequence alignment. RESULTS:
	We have developed a new method, GRAPeFoot, which simultaneously aligns
	two full genomes and annotates a set of conserved regions exhibiting
	reduced rates of insertion, deletion and substitution mutations.
	We tested GRAPeFoot using the human and mouse genomes and compared
	its performance to a set of phastCons predictions hosted on the UCSC
	genome browser. Our results demonstrate that despite the use of only
	two genomes, GRAPeFoot identified constrained elements at rates comparable
	with phastCons, which analyzed data from 28 vertebrate genomes. This
	study demonstrates how integrated modelling of substitutions, indels

	the accuracy of functional element prediction. Our method utilized

	up to four sequences. RESULTS: We present a novel approach, implemented
	in the software package BigFoot, for performing phylogenetic footprinting
	on greater numbers of sequences. We have developed a Markov chain
	Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach which samples both sequence alignments

	the processes by which genetic variation within species (polymorphism)
	becomes converted into genetic differences between species (divergence).
	In this transformation, selective neutrality, near neutrality, and
	positive selection may each play a role, differing from one gene
	to the next. Synonymous nucleotide sites are often used as a uniform
	standard of comparison across genes on the grounds that synonymous
	sites are subject to relatively weak selective constraints and so
	may, to a first approximation, be regarded as neutral. Synonymous
	sites are also interdigitated with nonsynonymous sites and so are
	affected equally by genomic context and demographic factors. Hence
	a comparison of levels of polymorphism and divergence between synonymous
	sites and amino acid replacement sites in a gene is potentially informative
	about the magnitude of selective forces associated with amino acid
	replacements. We have analyzed 56 genes in which polymorphism data
	from D. simulans are compared with divergence from a reference strain
	of D. melanogaster. The framework of the analysis is Bayesian and
	assumes that the distribution of selective effects (Malthusian fitnesses)
	is Gaussian with a mean that differs for each gene. In such a model,
	the average scaled selection intensity (gamma = N(e)s) of amino acid
	replacements eligible to become polymorphic or fixed is -7.31, and
	the standard deviation of selective effects within each locus is
	6.79 (assuming homoscedasticity across loci). For newly arising mutations
	of this type that occur in autosomal or X-linked genes, the average
	proportion of beneficial mutations is 19.7\%. Among the amino acid
	polymorphisms in the sample, the expected average proportion of beneficial
	mutations is 47.7\%, and among amino acid replacements that become
	fixed the average proportion of beneficial mutations is 94.3\%. The
	average scaled selection intensity of fixed mutations is +5.1. The
	presence of positive selection is pervasive with the single exception
	of kl-5, a Y-linked fertility gene. We find no evidence that a significant
	fraction of fixed amino acid replacements is neutral or nearly neutral
	or that positive selection drives amino acid replacements at only
	a subset of the loci. These results are model dependent and we discuss

	fact that, because of recombination, this clustering tends to be
	local in nature, our model allows cluster memberships to change continuously

	FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Using the HapMap and Perlegen polymorphism
	data that map to a stringent set of putative binding sites in human
	proximal promoters, we apply the Derived Allele Frequency distribution
	test of neutrality to provide evidence that many human-specific and

	We show that it can overcome certain computational artifacts of traditional

	The burgeoning field of cis-regulatory evolution, which is amply

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The Monte Carlo simulation of sequence evolution
	is routinely used to assess the performance of phylogenetic inference
	methods and sequence alignment algorithms. Progress in the field
	of molecular evolution fuels the need for more realistic and hence
	more complex simulations, adapted to particular situations, yet current
	software makes unreasonable assumptions such as homogeneous substitution
	dynamics or a uniform distribution of indels across the simulated
	sequences. This calls for an extensible simulation framework written
	in a high-level functional language, offering new functionality and
	making it easy to incorporate further complexity. RESULTS: PhyloSim
	is an extensible framework for the Monte Carlo simulation of sequence
	evolution, written in R, using the Gillespie algorithm to integrate
	the actions of many concurrent processes such as substitutions, insertions
	and deletions. Uniquely among sequence simulation tools, PhyloSim
	can simulate arbitrarily complex patterns of rate variation and multiple
	indel processes, and allows for the incorporation of selective constraints
	on indel events. User-defined complex patterns of mutation and selection
	can be easily integrated into simulations, allowing PhyloSim to be
	adapted to specific needs. CONCLUSIONS: Close integration with R
	and the wide range of features implemented offer unmatched flexibility,
	making it possible to simulate sequence evolution under a wide range
	of realistic settings. We believe that PhyloSim will be useful to
	future studies involving simulated alignments.},

  abstract = {Species phylogenies derived from comparisons of single genes are rarely

	less sensitive to such inconsistencies and more representative of
	whole-genomes than are single-gene trees. Here, we present a distance-based
	phylogeny constructed on the basis of gene content, rather than on
	sequence identity, of 13 completely sequenced genomes of unicellular
	species. The similarity between two species is defined as the number
	of genes that they have in common divided by their total number of
	genes. In this type of phylogenetic analysis, evolutionary distance
	can be interpreted in terms of evolutionary events such as the acquisition
	and loss of genes, whereas the underlying properties (the gene content)
	can be interpreted in terms of function. As such, it takes a position
	intermediate to phylogenies based on single genes and phylogenies
	based on phenotypic characteristics. Although our comprehensive genome
	phylogeny is independent of phylogenies based on the level of sequence
	identity of individual genes, it correlates with the standard reference
	of prokarytic phylogeny based on sequence similarity of 16s rRNA.
	Thus, shared gene content between genomes is quantitatively determined
	by phylogeny, rather than by phenotype, and horizontal gene transfer
	has only a limited role in determining the gene content of genomes.},

	The purpose of this study is to employ modern molecular selection
	approaches to predict sites under positive selection pressure in
	PBPs, derived from a large international S. pneumoniae collection
	of amoxicillin resistant and susceptible isolates, and encompassing
	a comparative data set of 354 pbp1a, 335 pbp2b, and 389 pbp2x gene

	Molecular adaptation was evident throughout PBP2X, with numerous
	positively selected sites in both the transpeptidase (TP) and C-terminal
	domains, strongly correlated with discriminating amoxicillin MICs.
	In the case of PBP1A positive selection was present in the glycosyltransfer
	(GT), TP and C-terminal domains. Sites within the TP domain tended
	to be correlated with the discrimination of low from intermediate
	MICs, whereas sites within the C-terminal tail, with a discrimination
	of intermediate from fully resistant. Most of the positively selected
	sites within PBP2B were in the N-terminal domain and were not correlated
	with amoxicillin MICs, however, several sites taken from the literature
	for the TP domain were strongly associated with discriminating high
	from intermediate level amoxicillin resistance. Many of the positively
	selected sites could be directly associated with functional inferences

	exhibit increased virulence. For example, it has been known for almost
	90 y that clinical isolates of the human bacterial pathogen group
	A streptococci (GAS) have extensive phenotypic heterogeneity linked
	to variation in virulence. However, the complete underlying molecular
	mechanism(s) have not been defined. Expression microarray analysis
	of nine clinical isolates identified two fundamentally different
	transcriptomes, designated pharyngeal transcriptome profile (PTP)

	in approximately 10\% of the transcriptome, including at least 23
	proven or putative virulence factor genes. ITP organisms were recovered
	from skin lesions of mice infected subcutaneously with PTP GAS and
	were significantly more able to survive phagocytosis and killing
	by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Complete genome resequencing
	of a mouse-derived ITP GAS revealed that the organism differed from
	its precursor by only a 7-bp frameshift mutation in the gene (covS)
	encoding the sensor kinase component of a two-component signal transduction
	system implicated in virulence. Genetic complementation, and sequence
	analysis of covR/S in 42 GAS isolates confirmed the central role
	of covR/S in transcriptome, exoproteome, and virulence modulation.
	Genome-wide analysis provides a heretofore unattained understanding

  abstract = {Knowledge of haplotypes is useful for understanding block structure
	in the genome and disease risk associations. Direct measurement of
	haplotypes in the absence of family data is presently impractical,
	and hence, several methods have been developed for reconstructing
	haplotypes from population data. We have developed a new population-based
	method using a Bayesian Hidden Markov model for the source of the
	ancestral haplotype segments. In our Bayesian model, a higher order
	Markov model is used as the prior for ancestral haplotypes, to account
	for linkage disequilibrium. Our model includes parameters for the
	genotyping error rate, the mutation rate, and the recombination rate
	at each position. Computation is done by Markov Chain Monte Carlo
	using the forward-backward algorithm to efficiently sum over all
	possible state sequences of the Hidden Markov model. We have used
	the model to reconstruct the haplotypes of 129 children at a region
	on chromosome 5 in the data set of Daly et al. [2001] (for which
	true haplotypes are obtained based on parental genotypes) and of
	30 children at selected regions in the CEU and YRI data of the HAPMAP
	project. The results are quite close to the family-based reconstructions
	and comparable with the state-of-the-art PHASE program. Our haplotype
	reconstruction method does not require division of the markers into
	small blocks of loci. The recombination rates inferred from our model
	can help to predict haplotype block boundaries, and estimate recombination
	hotspots.},

	factors in other bacteria. Analyses of proteomes by pooling data
	across genes, by biochemical category, clade, or branch, provided

	changes in epistatic genetic backgrounds may convert formerly neutral
	mutations into beneficial alleles in the new genetic background.
	By extending the coalescent theory to describe the genealogical histories
	of two interacting loci, I here investigated the hitchhiking effect
	of epistatic selection on the amount and pattern of sequence diversity
	at the linked neutral regions. Assuming a specific form of epistasis
	between two new mutations that are independently neutral, but together
	form a coadapted haplotype, I demonstrate that the footprints of
	epistatic selection differ markedly between the interacting loci
	depending on the order and relative timing of the two mutational
	events, even though both mutations are equally essential for the
	formation of an adaptive gene combination. Our results imply that
	even when neutrality tests could detect just a single instance of
	adaptive substitution, there may, in fact, be numerous other hidden
	mutations that are left undetected, but still play indispensable
	roles in the evolution of a new adaptation. We expect that the integration
	of the coalescent framework into the general theory of polygenic
	inheritance would clarify the connection between factors driving
	phenotypic evolution and their consequences on underlying DNA sequence
	changes, which should further illuminate the evolutionary foundation

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Insertions and deletions (indels) are an important evolutionary
	force, making the evolutionary process more efficient and flexible
	by copying and removing genomic fragments of various lengths instead
	of rediscovering them by point mutations. As a mutational process,
	indels are known to be more active in specific sequences (like micro-satellites)
	but not much is known about the more general and mechanistic effect
	of sequence context on the insertion and deletion susceptibility
	of genomic loci. RESULTS: Here we analyze a large collection of high
	confidence short insertions and deletions in primates and flies,
	revealing extensive correlations between sequence context and indel
	rates and building principled models for predicting these rates from
	sequence. According to our results, the rate of insertion or deletion
	of specific lengths can vary by more than 100-fold, depending on
	the surrounding sequence. These mutational biases can strongly influence
	the composition of the genome and the rate at which particular sequences
	appear. We exemplify this by showing how degenerate loci in human
	exons are selected to reduce their frame shifting indel propensity.
	CONCLUSION: Insertions and deletions are strongly affected by sequence
	context. Consequentially, genomes must adapt to significant variation
	in the mutational input at indel-prone and indel-immune loci.},

	Here, we examine the connection between patterns of nucleosome occupancy

	i.e., transcriptional plasticity. By analyzing genome-wide data of
	nucleosome positioning in yeast, we find that the presence of nucleosomes
	close to the transcription start site is associated with high transcriptional
	plasticity, while nucleosomes at more distant upstream positions
	are negatively correlated with transcriptional plasticity. Based
	on this, we identify two typical promoter structures associated with
	low or high plasticity, respectively. The first class is characterized
	by a relatively large nucleosome-free region close to the start site
	coupled with well-positioned nucleosomes further upstream, whereas
	the second class displays a more evenly distributed and dynamic nucleosome
	positioning, with high occupancy close to the start site. The two
	classes are further distinguished by multiple promoter features,
	including histone turnover, binding site locations, H2A.Z occupancy,
	expression noise, and expression diversity. Analysis of nucleosome

	in providing adaptive immunity against elements with high local resemblance
	to genomes of previously infecting agents. Here, we analyze the CRISPR
	loci of 51 complete genomes of Escherichia and Salmonella. CRISPR
	are in two pairs of loci in Escherichia, one single pair in Salmonella,
	each pair showing a similar turnover rate, repeat sequence and putative

	pair seems specialized in plasmids often matching genes coding for
	the replication, conjugation and antirestriction machinery. Strikingly,
	this pair also matches the cognate cas genes in which case these
	genes are absent. The unexpectedly high conservation of this anti-CRISPR
	suggests selection to counteract the invasion of mobile elements
	containing functional CRISPR/cas systems. There are few spacers in
	most CRISPR, which rarely match genomes of known phages. Furthermore,
	we found that strains divergent less than 250 thousand years ago
	show virtually identical CRISPR. The lack of congruence between cas,
	CRISPR and the species phylogeny and the slow pace of CRISPR change
	make CRISPR poor epidemiological markers in enterobacteria. All these
	observations are at odds with the expectedly abundant and dynamic
	repertoire of spacers in an immune system aiming at protecting bacteria

	the core promoter elements. A global transcriptional analysis demonstrated
	that MtsR modulates the expression of 64 genes in GAS, 44 of which

	controls genes with diverse functions including metal homeostasis,
	nucleic acid and amino acid metabolism, and protein fate. Importantly,
	the MtsR regulon includes mga, emm49 and ska, which are central for
	GAS pathogenesis. MtsR binding to the promoter region of both negatively
	and positively regulated genes demonstrates that it functions as
	a dual regulator. MtsR footprints are large (47-130 bp) and vary
	between target promoters. A 16 bp motif that consists of an interrupted
	palindrome is implicated in the DNA recognition by the metalloregulator.
	In conclusion, we report here that MtsR is a global regulator in

  abstract = {Both experimental as well as sequence evolution evidence suggests
	that transcription factor binding sites can undergo divergence and

	Furthermore, it is likely that there exist lineage specific differences
	in the retention rate of binding sites that make it desirable to
	estimate the rate of acquisition and decay of transcription factor
	binding sites from comparative sequence data. In this paper we propose
	a stochastic, phenomenological model for binding site turnover. For
	a given genomic region we assume a constant rate of binding site
	origination lambda and a constant per site decay rate of mu. We derived
	an explicit expression for the conditional probability distribution
	of the number of binding sites n at time t given n(0) binding sites
	at t=0. The analytical result was compared to a simulation model
	and we found that it closely predicts the simulated sequence evolution.
	We then analyzed a small data set of the number of estrogen response
	elements (ERE) in mammalian HoxA sequences and showed that the data
	is broadly consistent with the assumption of a stationary turnover
	process. A regression of shared EREs over the time since divergence
	led to an estimate of the half-life time for an ERE in the primate
	HoxA clusters of about 27 Myr, which corresponds to a per site decay
	rate of mu approximately 1.3 x 10(-8)/year and a rate of origination
	of lambda approximately 1.6 x 10(-7)/year. We conclude that the model
	can be used to estimate the rate of binding site turnover from comparative

  abstract = {Estimates of the scaled selection coefficient, gamma of Sawyer and

	Estimates of mutation parameters and divergence times, in contrast,
	are very sensitive to subdivision. These results follow from an analysis
	of natural selection and genetic drift in the island model of subdivision
	in the limit of a very large number of subpopulations, or demes.
	In particular, a diffusion process is shown to hold for the average
	allele frequency among demes in which the level of subdivision sets
	the timescale of drift and selection and determines the dynamic equilibrium
	of allele frequencies among demes. This provides a framework for
	inference about mutation, selection, divergence, and migration when
	data are available from a number of unlinked nucleotide sites. The
	effects of subdivision on parameter estimates depend on the distribution
	of samples among demes. If samples are taken singly from different
	demes, the only effect of subdivision is in the rescaling of mutation
	and divergence-time parameters. If multiple samples are taken from
	one or more demes, high levels of within-deme relatedness lead to
	low levels of intraspecies polymorphism and increase the number of
	fixed differences between samples from two species. If subdivision
	is ignored, mutation parameters are underestimated and the species
	divergence time is overestimated, sometimes quite drastically. Estimates

	thought to occur vertically and reflect the evolution of the genetic
	code. Yet there have been several indications that a tRNA gene could
	evolve horizontally, from a copy of an alloacceptor tRNA gene in
	the same genome. Earlier, we provided the first unambiguous evidence
	for the occurrence of such "tRNA gene recruitment" in nature - in
	the mitochondrial (mt) genome of the demosponge Axinella corrugata.
	Yet the extent and the pattern of this process in the evolution of
	tRNA gene families remained unclear. Here we analyzed tRNA genes
	from 21 mt genomes of demosponges as well as nuclear genomes of rhesus
	macaque, chimpanzee and human. We found four new cases of alloacceptor
	tRNA gene recruitment in mt genomes and eleven cases in the nuclear
	genomes. In most of these cases we observed a single nucleotide substitution
	at the middle position of the anticodon, which resulted in the change
	of not only the tRNA's amino-acid identity but also the class of
	the amino-acyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) involved in amino-acylation.
	We hypothesize that the switch to a different class of aaRSs may
	have prevented the conflict between anticodon and amino-acid identities

	sites and the regulatory circuitry that they define is currently
	an area of intense research. Data from whole-genome chromatin immunoprecipitation
	(ChIP-chip), whole-genome expression microarrays, and sequencing
	of multiple closely related genomes have all proven useful. By and
	large, existing methods treat the interpretation of functional data
	as a classification problem (between bound and unbound DNA), and
	the analysis of comparative data as a problem of local alignment
	(to recover phylogenetic footprints of presumably functional elements).
	Both of these approaches suffer from the inability to model and detect
	low-affinity binding sites, which have recently been shown to be
	abundant and functional. RESULTS: We have developed a method that
	discovers functional regulatory targets of TFs by predicting the
	total affinity of each promoter for those factors and then comparing
	that affinity across orthologous promoters in closely related species.
	At each promoter, we consider the minimum affinity among orthologs
	to be the fraction of the affinity that is functional. Because we
	calculate the affinity of the entire promoter, our method is independent
	of local alignment. By comparing with functional annotation information
	and gene expression data in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have validated
	that this biophysically motivated use of evolutionary conservation
	gives rise to dramatic improvement in prediction of regulatory connectivity
	and factor-factor interactions compared to the use of a single genome.
	We propose novel biological functions for several yeast TFs, including
	the factors Snt2 and Stb4, for which no function has been reported.
	Our affinity-based approach towards comparative genomics may allow
	a more quantitative analysis of the principles governing the evolution
	of non-coding DNA. AVAILABILITY: The MatrixREDUCE software package

	responsible for a significant proportion of bovine mastitis in commercial

	gut, genital tract and mammary gland. Comparative analysis of the
	complete genome sequence of S. uberis strain 0140J was undertaken
	to help elucidate the biology of this effective bovine pathogen.
	RESULTS: The genome revealed 1,825 predicted coding sequences (CDSs)
	of which 62 were identified as pseudogenes or gene fragments. Comparisons
	with related pyogenic streptococci identified a conserved core (40\%)
	of orthologous CDSs. Intriguingly, S. uberis 0140J displayed a lower
	number of mobile genetic elements when compared with other pyogenic
	streptococci, however bacteriophage-derived islands and a putative
	genomic island were identified. Comparative genomics analysis revealed
	most similarity to the genomes of Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus
	equi subsp. zooepidemicus. In contrast, streptococcal orthologs were
	not identified for 11\% of the CDSs, indicating either unique retention
	of ancestral sequence, or acquisition of sequence from alternative
	sources. Functions including transport, catabolism, regulation and
	CDSs encoding cell envelope proteins were over-represented in this
	unique gene set; a limited array of putative virulence CDSs were
	identified. CONCLUSION: S. uberis utilises nutritional flexibility
	derived from a diversity of metabolic options to successfully occupy
	a discrete ecological niche. The features observed in S. uberis are

  abstract = {Many microorganisms exhibit high levels of intragenic recombination
	following horizontal gene transfer events. Furthermore, many microbial
	genes are subject to strong diversifying selection as part of the
	pathogenic process. A multiple sequence alignment is an essential
	starting point for many of the tools that provide fundamental insights
	on gene structure and evolution, such as phylogenetics; however,
	an accurate alignment is not always possible to attain. In this study,
	a new analytic approach was developed in order to better quantify
	the genetic organization of highly diversified genes whose alleles
	do not align. This BLAST-based method, denoted BLAST Miner, employs
	an iterative process that places short segments of highly similar
	sequence into discrete datasets that are designated "modules." The
	relative positions of modules along the length of the genes, and
	their frequency of occurrence, are used to identify sequence duplications,
	insertions, and rearrangements. Partial alleles of sof from Streptococcus
	pyogenes, encoding a surface protein under host immune selection,
	were analyzed for module content. High-frequency Modules 6 and 13
	were identified and examined in depth. Nucleotide sequences corresponding
	to both modules contain numerous duplications and inverted repeats,
	whereby many codons form palindromic pairs. Combined with evidence
	for a strong codon usage bias, data suggest that Module 6 and 13
	sequences are under selection to preserve their nucleic acid secondary
	structure. The concentration of overlapping tandem and inverted repeats
	within a small region of DNA is highly suggestive of a mechanistic
	role for Module 6 and 13 sequences in promoting aberrant recombination.
	Analysis of pbp2X alleles from Streptococcus pneumoniae, encoding
	cell wall enzymes that confer antibiotic resistance, supports the
	broad applicability of this tool in deciphering the genetic organization
	of highly recombined genes. BLAST Miner shares with phylogenetics
	the important predictive quality that leads to the generation of
	testable hypotheses based on sequence data.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Despite trends towards maximum likelihood and Bayesian
	criteria, maximum parsimony (MP) remains an important criterion for
	evaluating phylogenetic trees. Because exact MP search is NP-complete,
	the computational effort needed to find provably optimal trees skyrockets
	with increasing numbers of taxa, limiting analyses to around 25-30
	taxa. This is in part because currently available programs fail to
	take advantage of parallelism. RESULTS: We present XMP, a new program
	for finding exact MP trees that comes in both serial and parallel
	versions. The serial version is faster in nearly all tests than existing
	software. The parallel version uses a work-stealing algorithm to
	scale to hundreds of CPUs on a distributed-memory multiprocessor
	with high efficiency. An optimised SSE2 inner loop provides additional
	speedup for Pentium 4 and later CPUs. AVAILABILITY: C source code,
	and several binary versions, are freely available from http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wtwhite/xmp.

  abstract = {Two-component systems (TCSs) are diverse and abundant signal transduction
	pathways found predominantly in prokaryotes. This review focuses
	on insights into TCS evolution made possible by the sequencing of
	whole prokaryotic genomes. Typical TCSs comprise an autophosphorylating
	protein (a histidine kinase), which transfers a phosphoryl group
	onto an effector protein (a response regulator), thus modulating
	its activity. Histidine kinases and response regulators are usually
	found encoded as pairs of adjacent genes within a genome, with multiple
	examples in most prokaryotes. Recent studies have shed light on major
	themes of TCS evolution, including gene duplication, gene gain/loss,
	gene fusion/fission, domain gain/loss, domain shuffling and the emergence
	of complexity. Coupled with an understanding of the structural and
	biophysical properties of many TCS proteins, it has become increasingly
	possible to draw inferences regarding the functional consequences
	of such evolutionary changes. In turn, this increase in understanding
	has the potential to enhance both our ability to rationally engineer

	contemporary genetic diversity and empirical evidence to piece together
	the evolutionary history of C. jejuni and quantify its evolutionary
	potential. Our combined population genetics-phylogenetics approach
	reveals a surprising picture. Campylobacter jejuni is a rapidly evolving
	species, subject to intense purifying selection that purges 60\%
	of novel variation, but possessing a massive evolutionary potential.
	The low mutation rate is offset by a large effective population size
	so that a mutation at any site can occur somewhere in the population
	within the space of a week. Recombination has a fundamental role,
	generating diversity at twice the rate of de novo mutation, and facilitating
	gene flow between C. jejuni and its sister species Campylobacter
	coli. We attempt to calibrate the rate of molecular evolution in
	C. jejuni based solely on within-species variation. The rates we
	obtain are up to 1,000 times faster than conventional estimates,
	placing the C. jejuni-C. coli split at the time of the Neolithic

	process when the taxonomic distributions of the individual AARSs

	transfer of AARS genes between Bacteria and Archaea is asymmetric:
	transfer of archaeal AARSs to the Bacteria is more prevalent than
	the reverse, which is seen only for the "gemini group. " (iv) The

	for gene-finding, especially because its flexibility enables the
	inclusion of various sequence features. Recent programs for bacterial
	gene-finding include the information of ribosomal binding site (RBS)
	to improve the recognition accuracy of the start codon, using this
	feature. We report here our attempt to extend the model into the
	total transcriptional unit, enabling the prediction of operon structures.
	RESULTS: First, we improved the prediction accuracy of coding sequences
	(CDSs) by employing the models of 'typical', 'atypical' and 'negative
	(false-positive)' classes as well as the models of RBS and its downstream
	spacer. The sensitivity of exactly predicting the 204 experimentally
	confirmed CDSs reached 90.2\% in an objective test. Based on the
	prediction result of CDSs, the positions of the promoters and terminators
	were predicted. Our model could exactly recognize 60\% of 390 known
	transcriptional units. Thus, the accuracy and significance of this
	prediction problem is far from trivial. We would like to propose
	this problem as an open theme in bioinformatics because the ongoing

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We develop a Bayesian method based on MCMC for estimating
	the relative rates of pericentric and paracentric inversions from
	marker data from two species. The method also allows estimation of
	the distribution of inversion tract lengths. RESULTS: We apply the
	method to data from Drosophila melanogaster and D. yakuba. We find
	that pericentric inversions occur at a much lower rate compared to
	paracentric inversions. The average paracentric inversion tract length
	is approx. 4.8 Mb with small inversions being more frequent than
	large inversions. If the two breakpoints defining a paracentric inversion
	tract are uniformly and independently distributed over chromosome
	arms there will be more short tract-length inversions than long;
	we find an even greater preponderance of short tract lengths than
	this would predict. Thus there appears to be a correlation between
	the positions of breakpoints which favors shorter tract lengths.
	CONCLUSION: The method developed in this paper provides the first
	statistical estimator for estimating the distribution of inversion
	tract lengths from marker data. Application of this method for a
	number of data sets may help elucidate the relationship between the
	length of an inversion and the chance that it will get accepted.},

	of phenotypic diversity. Although widespread differences in gene
	expression among individuals of a species have been observed, studies
	to examine the variability of transcription factor binding on a global
	scale have not been performed, and thus the extent and underlying
	genetic basis of transcription factor binding diversity is unknown.
	By mapping differences in transcription factor binding among individuals,
	here we present the genetic basis of such variation on a genome-wide
	scale. Whole-genome Ste12-binding profiles were determined using
	chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with DNA sequencing in pheromone-treated
	cells of 43 segregants of a cross between two highly diverged yeast
	strains and their parental lines. We identified extensive Ste12-binding
	variation among individuals, and mapped underlying cis- and trans-acting
	loci responsible for such variation. We showed that most transcription
	factor binding variation is cis-linked, and that many variations
	are associated with polymorphisms residing in the binding motifs
	of Ste12 as well as those of several proposed Ste12 cofactors. We
	also identified two trans-factors, AMN1 and FLO8, that modulate Ste12
	binding to promoters of more than ten genes under alpha-factor treatment.
	Neither of these two genes was previously known to regulate Ste12,
	and we suggest that they may be mediators of gene activity and phenotypic
	diversity. Ste12 binding strongly correlates with gene expression
	for more than 200 genes, indicating that binding variation is functional.
	Many of the variable-bound genes are involved in cell wall organization
	and biogenesis. Overall, these studies identified genetic regulators
	of molecular diversity among individuals and provide new insights

	the "GenoSpectrum" that consists of all possible genotypes and their

	clustering algorithm based on multi-genotyping data, which also assigns
	a "GenoSpectrum" for each individual. We then describe two hybrid
	EM algorithms (called DS-EM and MG-EM) that perform haplotype inference
	based on "GenoSpectrum" of each individual obtained by double sampling
	and multi-genotyping data. Both simulated data sets and a quasi real-data

  abstract = {The phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS)
	represents hitherto the only example of group translocation transport
	systems. PTS transporters are exclusively found in bacteria and can
	be grouped on the basis of sequence and structure into six classes.
	We have analyzed the evolution of mannose-class PTS transporters.
	These transporters have a limited distribution among bacteria being
	mostly harbored by species associated to animals. The results obtained
	indicate that these genes have undergone a complex evolutionary history,
	including extensive horizontal gene transfer events, duplications,
	and nonorthologous displacements. The phylogenetic analysis revealed
	an early diversification to specialize in different transport capabilities,
	but these events have also occurred relatively recently. In addition,
	these transporters can be further divided into seven groups and this
	division correlates with their transport capabilities. Finally, the
	consideration of the genomic context allowed us to propose putative
	functional roles for some uncharacterized PTS transporters. The functional
	role and distribution of mannose-class PTS transporters suggest that
	their expansion may have played a significant role in the establishment
	of symbiotic relationships between animals and some bacteria.},
