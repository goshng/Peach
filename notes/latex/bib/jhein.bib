  abstract = {Algorithms are presented that allow the calculation of the probability
	of a set of sequences related by a binary tree that have evolved
	according to the Thorne-Kishino-Felsenstein model for a fixed set
	of parameters. The algorithms are based on a Markov chain generating
	sequences and their alignment at nodes in a tree. Depending on whether
	the complete realization of this Markov chain is decomposed into
	the first transition and the rest of the realization or the last
	transition and the first part of the realization, two kinds of recursions
	are obtained that are computationally similar but probabilistically
	different. The running time of the algorithms is O(Pi id=1 Li), where
	Li is the length of the ith observed sequences and d is the number
	of sequences. An alternative recursion is also formulated that uses
	only a Markov chain involving the inner nodes of a tree.},

  abstract = {In hidden Markov models, the probability of observing a set of strings
	can be computed using recursion relations. We construct a sufficient
	condition for simplifying the recursion relations for a certain class
	of hidden Markov models. If the condition is satisfied, then one
	can construct a reduced recursion where the dependence on Markov
	states completely disappears. We discuss a specific example--namely,
	statistical multiple alignment based on the TKF-model--in which the
	sufficient condition is satisfied.},
