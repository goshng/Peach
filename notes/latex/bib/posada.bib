  title = {BIONJ: an improved version of the NJ algorithm based on a simple
	model of sequence data.},
  journal = {Mol Biol Evol},

  abstract = {We propose an improved version of the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm
	of Saitou and Nei. This new algorithm, BIONJ, follows the same agglomerative
	scheme as NJ, which consists of iteratively picking a pair of taxa,
	creating a new mode which represents the cluster of these taxa, and
	reducing the distance matrix by replacing both taxa by this node.
	Moreover, BIONJ uses a simple first-order model of the variances
	and covariances of evolutionary distance estimates. This model is
	well adapted when these estimates are obtained from aligned sequences.
	At each step it permits the selection, from the class of admissible
	reductions, of the reduction which minimizes the variance of the
	new distance matrix. In this way, we obtain better estimates to choose
	the pair of taxa to be agglomerated during the next steps. Moreover,
	in comparison with NJ's estimates, these estimates become better
	and better as the algorithm proceeds. BIONJ retains the good properties
	of NJ--especially its low run time. Computer simulations have been
	performed with 12-taxon model trees to determine BIONJ's efficiency.
	When the substitution rates are low (maximum pairwise divergence
	approximately 0.1 substitutions per site) or when they are constant
	among lineages, BIONJ is only slightly better than NJ. When the substitution
	rates are higher and vary among lineages,BIONJ clearly has better
	topological accuracy. In the latter case, for the model trees and
	the conditions of evolution tested, the topological error reduction
	is on the average around 20\%. With highly-varying-rate trees and
	with high substitution rates (maximum pairwise divergence approximately
	1.0 substitutions per site), the error reduction may even rise above
	50\%, while the probability of finding the correct tree may be augmented
	by as much as 15\%.},

  abstract = {Models of character evolution underpin all phylogeny estimations,
	thus model adequacy remains a crucial issue for phylogenetics and
	its many applications. Although progress has been made in selecting
	appropriate models for phylogeny estimation, there is still concern
	about their purpose and proper use. How do we interpret models in
	a phylogenetic context? What are their effects on phylogeny estimation?
	How can we improve confidence in the models that we choose? That
	the phylogenetics community is asking such questions denotes an important
	stage in the use of explicit models. Here, we examine these and other
	common questions and draw conclusions about how the community is
	using and choosing models, and where this process will take us next.},

  abstract = {jModelTest is a new program for the statistical selection of models
	of nucleotide substitution based on "Phyml" (Guindon and Gascuel
	2003. A simple, fast, and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies
	by maximum likelihood. Syst Biol. 52:696-704.). It implements 5 different
	selection strategies, including "hierarchical and dynamical likelihood
	ratio tests," the "Akaike information criterion," the "Bayesian information
	criterion," and a "decision-theoretic performance-based" approach.
	This program also calculates the relative importance and model-averaged
	estimates of substitution parameters, including a model-averaged
	estimate of the phylogeny. jModelTest is written in Java and runs
	under Mac OSX, Windows, and Unix systems with a Java Runtime Environment
	installed. The program, including documentation, can be freely downloaded
	from the software section at http://darwin.uvigo.es.},
