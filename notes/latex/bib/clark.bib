  abstract = {There has recently been considerable interest in detecting natural
	selection in the human genome. Selection will usually tend to increase
	Identity By Descent (IBD) among individuals in a population, and
	many methods for detecting recent and ongoing positive selection
	indirectly take advantage of this. In this paper we show that excess
	Identity By Descent (IBD) sharing is a general property of natural
	selection and we show that this fact makes it possible to detect
	several types of selection including a type that is otherwise difficult
	to detect: selection acting on standing genetic variation. Motivated
	by this, we use a recently developed method for identifying IBD sharing
	among individuals from genome-wide data to scan populations from
	the new HapMap phase 3 project for regions with excess IBD sharing
	in order to identify regions in the human genome that have been under
	strong, very recent selection. The HLA region is by far the region
	showing the most extreme signal, suggesting that much of the strong
	recent selection acting on the human genome has been immune related
	and acting on HLA loci. As equilibrium overdominance does not tend
	to increase IBD, we argue that this type of selection cannot explain
	our observations.},

  abstract = {The identification of signals of very recent positive selection provides
	information about the adaptation of modern humans to local conditions.
	We report here on a genome-wide scan for signals of very recent positive
	selection in favor of variants that have not yet reached fixation.
	We describe a new analytical method for scanning single nucleotide
	polymorphism (SNP) data for signals of recent selection, and apply
	this to data from the International HapMap Project. In all three
	continental groups we find widespread signals of recent positive
	selection. Most signals are region-specific, though a significant
	excess are shared across groups. Contrary to some earlier low resolution
	studies that suggested a paucity of recent selection in sub-Saharan
	Africans, we find that by some measures our strongest signals of
	selection are from the Yoruba population. Finally, since these signals
	indicate the existence of genetic variants that have substantially
	different fitnesses, they must indicate loci that are the source
	of significant phenotypic variation. Though the relevant phenotypes
	are generally not known, such loci should be of particular interest
	in mapping studies of complex traits. For this purpose we have developed
	a set of SNPs that can be used to tag the strongest approximately
	250 signals of recent selection in each population.},
