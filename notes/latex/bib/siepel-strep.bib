  title = {Detecting lateral gene transfers by statistical reconciliation of
	phylogenetic forests.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {11},
  pages = {324},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: To understand the evolutionary role of Lateral Gene Transfer
	(LGT), accurate methods are needed to identify transferred genes
	and infer their timing of acquisition. Phylogenetic methods are particularly
	promising for this purpose, but the reconciliation of a gene tree
	with a reference (species) tree is computationally hard. In addition,
	the application of these methods to real data raises the problem
	of sorting out real and artifactual phylogenetic conflict. RESULTS:
	We present Prunier, a new method for phylogenetic detection of LGT
	based on the search for a maximum statistical agreement forest (MSAF)
	between a gene tree and a reference tree. The program is flexible
	as it can use any definition of "agreement" among trees. We evaluate
	the performance of Prunier and two other programs (EEEP and RIATA-HGT)
	for their ability to detect transferred genes in realistic simulations
	where gene trees are reconstructed from sequences. Prunier proposes
	a single scenario that compares to the other methods in terms of
	sensitivity, but shows higher specificity. We show that LGT scenarios
	carry a strong signal about the position of the root of the species
	tree and could be used to identify the direction of evolutionary
	time on the species tree. We use Prunier on a biological dataset
	of 23 universal proteins and discuss their suitability for inferring
	the tree of life. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of Prunier to take into
	account branch support in the process of reconciliation allows a
	gain in complexity, in comparison to EEEP, and in accuracy in comparison
	to RIATA-HGT. Prunier's greedy algorithm proposes a single scenario
	of LGT for a gene family, but its quality always compares to the
	best solutions provided by the other algorithms. When the root position
	is uncertain in the species tree, Prunier is able to infer a scenario
	per root at a limited additional computational cost and can easily
	run on large datasets.Prunier is implemented in C++, using the Bio++
	library and the phylogeny program Treefinder. It is available at:

	disease burden and sometimes cause disease outbreaks. Little is known
	about the critical epidemiologic parameter of genetic relatedness
	between isolates. We determined the emm types of 334 Streptococcus
	dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates, and attempted emm typing
	of 5 Streptococcus canis isolates from a recent population-based
	surveillance for invasive isolates. Thirty-four emm types were observed,
	including one from S. canis. We formulated multilocus sequence typing
	(MLST) primers with six of the seven loci corresponding to the Streptococcus
	pyogenes MLST scheme. We performed MLST with 65 of the 334 surveillance
	isolates (61 S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates, 4 S. canis
	isolates) to represent each emm type identified, including 2 to 3
	isolates for each of the 25 redundantly represented emm types. Forty-one
	MLST sequence types (STs) were observed. Isolates within 16 redundantly
	represented S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis emm types shared identical
	or nearly identical STs, demonstrating concordance between the emm
	type and genetic relatedness. However, seven STs were each represented
	by two to four different emm types, and 7 of the 10 S. dysgalactiae
	subsp. equisimilis eBURST groups represented up to six different
	emm types. Thus, S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis isolates were
	similar to S. pyogenes isolates, in that strains of the same emm
	type were often highly related, but they differed from S. pyogenes,
	in that S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis strains with identical
	or closely similar STs often exhibited multiple unrelated emm types.
	The phylogenetic relationships between S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis
	and S. pyogenes alleles revealed a history of interspecies recombination,
	with either species often serving as genetic donors. The four S.
	canis isolates shared highly homologous alleles but were unrelated
	clones without evidence of past recombination with S. dysgalactiae
	subsp. equisimilis or S. pyogenes.},

  abstract = {With the easy acquisition of sequence data, it is now possible to
	obtain and align whole genomes across multiple related species or

	method to reconstruct the whole distribution of phylogenetic trees
	along the genome, estimate the proportion of the genome for which
	a given clade is true, and infer a concordance tree that summarizes
	the dominant vertical inheritance pattern. There are two main issues
	when dealing with whole-genome alignments, as opposed to multiple
	genes: the size of the data and the detection of recombination breakpoints.
	These breakpoints partition the genomic alignment into phylogenetically
	homogeneous loci, where sites within a given locus all share the
	same phylogenetic tree topology. To delimitate these loci, I describe
	here a method based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle,
	implemented with dynamic programming for computational efficiency.
	Simulations show that combining MDL partitioning with Bayesian concordance
	analysis provides an efficient and robust way to estimate both the
	vertical inheritance signal and the horizontal phylogenetic signal.
	The method performed well both in the presence of incomplete lineage
	sorting and in the presence of horizontal gene transfer. A high level
	of systematic bias was found here, highlighting the need for good
	individual tree building methods, which form the basis for more elaborate

	we label these gene variants that are exchanged between related species
	as homeoalleles. In a case study, we show that biased gene transfer
	plays an important role in the evolution of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
	(aaRS). Many microorganisms make use of these genes against naturally

	horizontal gene transfer (HGT), rather than an ancient duplication

	history of TyrRS in bacteria. However, for each TyrRS type, phylogenetic
	reconstruction yields phylogenies similar to the ribosomal phylogeny,

  year = {2007},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {154},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In comparative analyses of bacterial pathogens, it has
	been common practice to discriminate between two types of genes:
	(i) those shared by pathogens and their non-pathogenic relatives
	(core genes), and (ii) those found exclusively in pathogens (pathogen-specific
	accessory genes). Rather than attempting to a priori delineate genes
	into sets more or less relevant to pathogenicity, we took a broad
	approach to the analysis of Streptococcus species by investigating
	the strength of natural selection in all clusters of homologous genes.
	The genus Streptococcus is comprised of a wide variety of both pathogenic
	and commensal lineages, and we relate our findings to the pre-existing
	knowledge of Streptococcus virulence factors. RESULTS: Our analysis
	of 1730 gene clusters revealed 136 cases of positive Darwinian selection,
	which we suggest is most likely to result from an antagonistic interaction
	between the host and pathogen at the molecular level. A two-step
	validation procedure suggests that positive selection was robustly
	identified in our genomic survey. We found no evidence to support
	the notion that pathogen specific accessory genes are more likely
	to be subject to positive selection than core genes. Indeed, we even
	uncovered a few cases of essential gene evolution by positive selection.
	Among the gene clusters subject to positive selection, a large fraction
	(29\%) can be connected to virulence. The most striking finding was
	that a considerable fraction of the positively selected genes are
	also known to have tissue specific patterns of expression during
	invasive disease. As current expression data is far from comprehensive,
	we suggest that this fraction was underestimated. CONCLUSION: Our
	findings suggest that pathogen specific genes, although a popular
	focus of research, do not provide a complete picture of the evolutionary
	dynamics of virulence. The results of this study, and others, support
	the notion that the products of both core and accessory genes participate
	in complex networks that comprise the molecular basis of virulence.
	Future work should seek to understand the evolutionary dynamics of
	both core and accessory genes as a function of the networks in which
	they participate.},

	the molecular, genetic, and evolutionary basis for these differences
	remains unclear. In many Gram- negative bacteria, including the phytopathogen
	Pseudomonas syringae, type III effectors (TTEs) are essential for
	pathogenicity, instrumental in structuring host range, and exhibit
	wide diversity between strains. To capture the dynamic nature of
	virulence gene repertoires across P. syringae, we screened 11 diverse
	strains for novel TTE families and coupled this nearly saturating
	screen with the sequencing and assembly of 14 phylogenetically diverse
	isolates from a broad collection of diseased host plants. TTE repertoires
	vary dramatically in size and content across all P. syringae clades;
	surprisingly few TTEs are conserved and present in all strains. Those
	that are likely provide basal requirements for pathogenicity. We
	demonstrate that functional divergence within one conserved locus,
	hopM1, leads to dramatic differences in pathogenicity, and we demonstrate
	that phylogenetics-informed mutagenesis can be used to identify functionally
	critical residues of TTEs. The dynamism of the TTE repertoire is
	mirrored by diversity in pathways affecting the synthesis of secreted
	phytotoxins, highlighting the likely role of both types of virulence
	factors in determination of host range. We used these 14 draft genome
	sequences, plus five additional genome sequences previously reported,

	for all statistically significant linkage disequilibrium among strains

	specialists. Networked evolution and population structure analyses
	of loci representing each of the AGRs reveal that most strains with
	the skin specialist and generalist biomarkers form discrete clusters,
	whereas strains with the throat specialist biomarker are highly diverse.
	To identify coinherited and coselected accessory genes, the strength
	of genetic associations was determined for all possible pairwise
	combinations of accessory genes among the 97 GAS strains. Accessory
	genes showing very strong associations provide the basis for an evolutionary
	model, which reveals that a major transition between many throat
	and skin specialist haplotypes correlates with the gain or loss of
	genes encoding fibronectin-binding proteins. This study employs a
	novel synthesis of tools to help delineate the major genetic changes
	associated with key adaptive shifts in an extensively recombined
	bacterial species.},

	Since the microenvironments at the throat and skin are distinct,
	the signal transduction pathways leading to the control of gene expression
	may also differ for throat versus skin strains of S. pyogenes. Two
	loci (mga and rofA/nra) encoding global regulators of virulence gene
	expression are positioned 300 kb apart on the genome; each contains
	alleles forming two major sequence clusters of approximately 25 to
	30\% divergence that are under balancing selection. Strong linkage
	disequilibrium is observed between sequence clusters of the transcription
	regulatory loci and the subpopulations of throat and skin specialists,
	against a background of high recombination rates among housekeeping
	genes. A taxonomically distinct commensal species (Streptococcus

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The M type-specific surface protein antigens encoded by
	the 5' end of emm genes are targets of protective host immunity and
	attractive vaccine candidates against infection by Streptococcus
	pyogenes, a global human pathogen. A history of genetic change in
	emm was evaluated for a worldwide collection of > 500 S. pyogenes
	isolates that were defined for genetic background by multilocus sequence
	typing of housekeeping genes. RESULTS: Organisms were categorized
	by genotypes that roughly correspond to throat specialists, skin
	specialists, and generalists often recovered from infections at either
	tissue site. Recovery of distant clones sharing the same emm type
	was approximately 4-fold higher for skin specialists and generalists,
	as compared to throat specialists. Importantly, emm type was often
	a poor marker for clone. Recovery of clones that underwent recombinational
	replacement with a new emm type was most evident for the throat and
	skin specialists. The average ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions
	per nonsynonymous site (Ka) and synonymous substitutions per synonymous
	site (Ks) was 4.9, 1.5 and 1.3 for emm types of the throat specialist,
	skin specialist and generalist groups, respectively. CONCLUSION:
	Data indicate that the relationships between emm type and genetic
	background differ among the three host tissue-related groups, and
	that the selection pressures acting on emm appear to be strongest
	for the throat specialists. Since positive selection is likely due
	in part to a protective host immune response, the findings may have
	important implications for vaccine design and vaccination strategies.},

	coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since
	evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which
	E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population
	evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for >30,000 generations,
	although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using
	(Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations,

	of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary
	mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression
	is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these
	hypotheses in experiments that "replayed" evolution from different

	This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but
	did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of

	More generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially
	important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that

	RESULTS: Here, we present an alignment- and threshold-free comparative
	genomics approach for assigning functional roles to DNA regulatory
	motifs. We incorporate our approach into the Gomo algorithm, a computational
	tool for detecting associations between a user-specified DNA regulatory
	motif [expressed as a position weight matrix (PWM)] and Gene Ontology
	(GO) terms. Incorporating multiple species into the analysis significantly
	improves Gomo's ability to identify GO terms associated with the
	regulatory targets of TFs. Including three comparative species in
	the process of predicting TF roles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and
	Homo sapiens increases the number of significant predictions by 75
	and 200\%, respectively. The predicted GO terms are also more specific,
	yielding deeper biological insight into the role of the TF. Adjusting
	motif (binding) affinity scores for individual sequence composition
	proves to be essential for avoiding false positive associations.
	We describe a novel DNA sequence-scoring algorithm that compensates
	a thermodynamic measure of DNA-binding affinity for individual sequence
	base composition. GOMO's prediction accuracy proves to be relatively
	insensitive to how promoters are defined. Because GOMO uses a threshold-free
	form of gene set analysis, there are no free parameters to tune.
	Biologists can investigate the potential roles of DNA regulatory
	motifs of interest using GOMO via the web (http://meme.nbcr.net).},

	CNSs may arise from nonselective evolutionary processes such as genomic
	regions with extremely low mutation rates known as mutation "cold

	levels of divergence relative to levels of polymorphism, as well
	as a significant excess of rare derived alleles, compared with either
	the nonconserved spacer regions between CNSs or with 4-fold silent
	sites in coding regions. Controlling for the effects of purifying
	selection, we find no evidence of positive selection acting on Drosophila
	CNSs, although we do find evidence for the action of recurrent positive
	selection in the spacer regions between CNSs. We estimate that approximately
	85\% of sites in Drosophila CNSs are under constraint with selection
	coefficients (N(e)s) on the order of 10-100, and thus, the estimated
	strength and number of sites under purifying selection is greater
	for Drosophila CNSs relative to those in the human genome. These

	varying length, from a few nucleotides to chromosome size. Here we
	analyze 1,462 sets of single-copy, putatively orthologous genes from
	144 fully sequenced prokaryote genomes, asking to what extent complete
	genes and fragments of genes have been transferred and recombined

	breakpoint positive (ORB(+)) and negative (ORB(-)) respectively.
	The latter are prima facie instances of lateral transfer of an entire

  pages = {412},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic recombination can produce heterogeneous phylogenetic
	histories within a set of homologous genes. These recombination events
	can be obscured by subsequent residue substitutions, which consequently
	complicate their detection. While there are many algorithms for the
	identification of recombination events, little is known about the
	effects of subsequent substitutions on the accuracy of available
	recombination-detection approaches. RESULTS: We assessed the effect
	of subsequent substitutions on the detection of simulated recombination
	events within sets of four nucleotide sequences under a homogeneous
	evolutionary model. The amount of subsequent substitutions per site,
	prior evolutionary history of the sequences, and reciprocality or
	non-reciprocality of the recombination event all affected the accuracy
	of the recombination-detecting programs examined. Bayesian phylogenetic-based
	approaches showed high accuracy in detecting evidence of recombination
	event and in identifying recombination breakpoints. These approaches
	were less sensitive to parameter settings than other methods we tested,
	making them easier to apply to various data sets in a consistent
	manner. CONCLUSION: Post-recombination substitutions tend to diminish
	the predictive accuracy of recombination-detecting programs. The
	best method for detecting recombined regions is not necessarily the
	most accurate in identifying recombination breakpoints. For difficult
	detection problems involving highly divergent sequences or large
	data sets, different types of approach can be run in succession to
	increase efficiency, and can potentially yield better predictive
	accuracy than any single method used in isolation.},

  abstract = {In prokaryotes and some eukaryotes, genetic material can be transferred
	laterally among unrelated lineages and recombined into new host genomes,
	providing metabolic and physiological novelty. Although the process
	is usually framed in terms of gene sharing (e.g. lateral gene transfer,
	LGT), there is little reason to imagine that the units of transfer
	and recombination correspond to entire, intact genes. Proteins often
	consist of one or more spatially compact structural regions (domains)
	which may fold autonomously and which, singly or in combination,
	confer the protein's specific functions. As LGT is frequent in strongly
	selective environments and natural selection is based on function,
	we hypothesized that domains might also serve as modules of genetic
	transfer, i.e. that regions of DNA that are transferred and recombined
	between lineages might encode intact structural domains of proteins.We
	selected 1,462 orthologous gene sets representing 144 prokaryotic
	genomes, and applied a rigorous two-stage approach to identify recombination
	breakpoints within these sequences. Recombination breakpoints are
	very significantly over-represented in gene sets within which protein
	domain-encoding regions have been annotated. Within these gene sets,
	breakpoints significantly avoid the domain-encoding regions (domons),
	except where these regions constitute most of the sequence length.
	Recombination breakpoints that fall within longer domons are distributed
	uniformly at random, but those that fall within shorter domons may
	show a slight tendency to avoid the domon midpoint. As we find no
	evidence for differential selection against nucleotide substitutions
	following the recombination event, any bias against disruption of
	domains must be a consequence of the recombination event per se.This
	is the first systematic study relating the units of LGT to structural
	features at the protein level. Many genes have been interrupted by
	recombination following inter-lineage genetic transfer, during which
	the regions within these genes that encode protein domains have not
	been preferentially preserved intact. Protein domains are units of
	function, but domons are not modules of transfer and recombination.
	Our results demonstrate that LGT can remodel even the most functionally
	conservative modules within genomes.},

  pages = {179},
  abstract = {The universal ribosomal protein S4 is essential for the initiation
	of small subunit ribosomal assembly and translational accuracy. Being
	part of the information processing machinery of the cell, the gene
	for S4 is generally thought of as being inherited vertically and
	has been used in concatenated gene phylogenies. Here we report the
	evolution of ribosomal protein S4 in relation to a broad sharing
	of zinc/non-zinc forms of the gene and study the scope of horizontal
	gene transfer (HGT) of S4 during bacterial evolution.In this study
	we present the complex evolutionary history of ribosomal protein
	S4 using 660 bacterial genomes from 16 major bacterial phyla. According
	to conserved characteristics in the sequences, S4 can be classified
	into C+ (zinc-binding) and C- (zinc-free) variants, with 26 genomes
	(mainly from the class Clostridia) containing genes for both. A maximum
	likelihood phylogenetic tree of the S4 sequences was incongruent
	with the standard bacterial phylogeny, indicating a departure from
	strict vertical inheritance. Further analysis using the genome content
	near the S4 genes, which are usually located in a conserved gene
	cluster, showed not only that HGT of the C- gene had occurred at
	various stages of bacterial evolution, but also that both the C-
	and C+ genes were present before the individual phyla diverged. To
	explain the latter, we theorize that a gene pool existed early in
	bacterial evolution from which bacteria could sample S4 gene variants,
	according to environmental conditions. The distribution of the C+/-
	variants for seven other zinc-binding ribosomal proteins in these
	660 bacterial genomes is consistent with that seen for S4 and may
	shed light on the evolutionary pressures involved.The complex history
	presented for "core" protein S4 suggests the existence of a gene
	pool before the emergence of bacterial lineages and reflects the
	pervasive nature of HGT in subsequent bacterial evolution. This has
	implications for both theoretical models of evolution and practical
	applications of phylogenetic reconstruction as well as the control
	of zinc economy in bacterial cells.},

	for the inference of gains and losses of gene families. First, we
	develop probabilistic-evolutionary models describing the dynamics
	of gene-family content, which are more biologically realistic than
	previously suggested models. In our likelihood-based models, gains
	and losses are represented by transitions between presence and absence,
	given an underlying phylogeny. We employ a mixture-model approach

	gene families. Second, we use these models together with the analytic
	implementation of stochastic mapping to infer branch-specific events.
	Our novel methodology allows us to infer and quantify horizontal
	gene transfer (HGT) events. This enables us to rank various gene
	families and lineages according to their propensity to undergo gains
	and losses. Applying our methodology to 4,873 gene families shows
	that: 1) the novel mixture models describe the observed variability
	in gene-family content among microbes significantly better than previous
	models; 2) The stochastic mapping approach enables accurate inference
	of gain and loss events based on simulations; 3) At least 34\% of
	the gene families analyzed are inferred to have experienced HGT at
	least once during their evolution; and 4) Gene families that were
	inferred to experience HGT are both enriched and depleted with respect
	to specific functional categories.},

  abstract = {The phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) plays a major
	role in sugar transport and in the regulation of essential physiological
	processes in many bacteria. The PTS couples solute transport to its
	phosphorylation at the expense of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and it
	consists of general cytoplasmic phosphoryl transfer proteins and
	specific enzyme II complexes which catalyze the uptake and phosphorylation
	of solutes. Previous studies have suggested that the evolution of
	the constituents of the enzyme II complexes has been driven largely
	by horizontal gene transfer whereas vertical inheritance has been
	prevalent in the general phosphoryl transfer proteins in some bacterial
	groups. The aim of this work is to test this hypothesis by studying
	the evolution of the phosphoryl transfer proteins of the PTS.We have
	analyzed the evolutionary history of the PTS phosphoryl transfer
	chain (PTS-ptc) components in 222 complete genomes by combining phylogenetic
	methods and analysis of genomic context. Phylogenetic analyses alone
	were not conclusive for the deepest nodes but when complemented with
	analyses of genomic context and functional information, the main
	evolutionary trends of this system could be depicted.The PTS-ptc
	evolved in bacteria after the divergence of early lineages such as
	Aquificales, Thermotogales and Thermus/Deinococcus. The subsequent
	evolutionary history of the PTS-ptc varied in different bacterial
	lineages: vertical inheritance and lineage-specific gene losses mainly
	explain the current situation in Actinobacteria and Firmicutes whereas
	horizontal gene transfer (HGT) also played a major role in Proteobacteria.
	Most remarkably, we have identified a HGT event from Firmicutes or
	Fusobacteria to the last common ancestor of the Enterobacteriaceae,
	Pasteurellaceae, Shewanellaceae and Vibrionaceae. This transfer led
	to extensive changes in the metabolic and regulatory networks of
	these bacteria including the development of a novel carbon catabolite
	repression system. Hence, this example illustrates that HGT can drive
	major physiological modifications in bacteria.},

	To study the evolution of complete gene repertoires, we propose here

	family sizes across multiple genomes, are sufficient to infer principal

	According to our reconstruction, most lineages are characterized

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple genome alignment remains a challenging problem.
	Effects of recombination including rearrangement, segmental duplication,
	gain, and loss can create a mosaic pattern of homology even among
	closely related organisms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe
	a new method to align two or more genomes that have undergone rearrangements
	due to recombination and substantial amounts of segmental gain and
	loss (flux). We demonstrate that the new method can accurately align
	regions conserved in some, but not all, of the genomes, an important
	case not handled by our previous work. The method uses a novel alignment
	objective score called a sum-of-pairs breakpoint score, which facilitates
	accurate detection of rearrangement breakpoints when genomes have
	unequal gene content. We also apply a probabilistic alignment filtering
	method to remove erroneous alignments of unrelated sequences, which
	are commonly observed in other genome alignment methods. We describe
	new metrics for quantifying genome alignment accuracy which measure
	the quality of rearrangement breakpoint predictions and indel predictions.
	The new genome alignment algorithm demonstrates high accuracy in
	situations where genomes have undergone biologically feasible amounts
	of genome rearrangement, segmental gain and loss. We apply the new
	algorithm to a set of 23 genomes from the genera Escherichia, Shigella,
	and Salmonella. Analysis of whole-genome multiple alignments allows
	us to extend the previously defined concepts of core- and pan-genomes
	to include not only annotated genes, but also non-coding regions
	with potential regulatory roles. The 23 enterobacteria have an estimated
	core-genome of 2.46Mbp conserved among all taxa and a pan-genome
	of 15.2Mbp. We document substantial population-level variability
	among these organisms driven by segmental gain and loss. Interestingly,
	much variability lies in intergenic regions, suggesting that the
	Enterobacteriacae may exhibit regulatory divergence. CONCLUSIONS:
	The multiple genome alignments generated by our software provide
	a platform for comparative genomic and population genomic studies.
	Free, open-source software implementing the described genome alignment
	approach is available from http://gel.ahabs.wisc.edu/mauve.},

  abstract = {Genome structure variation has profound impacts on phenotype in organisms
	ranging from microbes to humans, yet little is known about how natural
	selection acts on genome arrangement. Pathogenic bacteria such as
	Yersinia pestis, which causes bubonic and pneumonic plague, often
	exhibit a high degree of genomic rearrangement. The recent availability
	of several Yersinia genomes offers an unprecedented opportunity to
	study the evolution of genome structure and arrangement. We introduce
	a set of statistical methods to study patterns of rearrangement in
	circular chromosomes and apply them to the Yersinia. We constructed
	a multiple alignment of eight Yersinia genomes using Mauve software
	to identify 78 conserved segments that are internally free from genome
	rearrangement. Based on the alignment, we applied Bayesian statistical
	methods to infer the phylogenetic inversion history of Yersinia.
	The sampling of genome arrangement reconstructions contains seven
	parsimonious tree topologies, each having different histories of
	79 inversions. Topologies with a greater number of inversions also
	exist, but were sampled less frequently. The inversion phylogenies
	agree with results suggested by SNP patterns. We then analyzed reconstructed
	inversion histories to identify patterns of rearrangement. We confirm
	an over-representation of "symmetric inversions"-inversions with
	endpoints that are equally distant from the origin of chromosomal
	replication. Ancestral genome arrangements demonstrate moderate preference
	for replichore balance in Yersinia. We found that all inversions
	are shorter than expected under a neutral model, whereas inversions
	acting within a single replichore are much shorter than expected.
	We also found evidence for a canonical configuration of the origin
	and terminus of replication. Finally, breakpoint reuse analysis reveals
	that inversions with endpoints proximal to the origin of DNA replication
	are nearly three times more frequent. Our findings represent the
	first characterization of genome arrangement evolution in a bacterial
	population evolving outside laboratory conditions. Insight into the
	process of genomic rearrangement may further the understanding of
	pathogen population dynamics and selection on the architecture of
	circular bacterial chromosomes.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: ATP-binding cassette (ABC) systems are universally distributed
	among living organisms and function in many different aspects of
	bacterial physiology. ABC transporters are best known for their role
	in the import of essential nutrients and the export of toxic molecules,
	but they can also mediate the transport of many other physiological
	substrates. In a classical transport reaction, two highly conserved
	ATP-binding domains or subunits couple the binding/hydrolysis of
	ATP to the translocation of particular substrates across the membrane,
	through interactions with membrane-spanning domains of the transporter.
	Variations on this basic theme involve soluble ABC ATP-binding proteins
	that couple ATP hydrolysis to nontransport processes, such as DNA
	repair and gene expression regulation. Insights into the structure,
	function, and mechanism of action of bacterial ABC proteins are reported,
	based on phylogenetic comparisons as well as classic biochemical
	and genetic approaches. The availability of an increasing number
	of high-resolution structures has provided a valuable framework for
	interpretation of recent studies, and realistic models have been
	proposed to explain how these fascinating molecular machines use
	complex dynamic processes to fulfill their numerous biological functions.
	These advances are also important for elucidating the mechanism of
	action of eukaryotic ABC proteins, because functional defects in
	many of them are responsible for severe human inherited diseases.},

	Here we provide the first characterization of a novel integrative
	conjugative element (ICE), ICESde3396, from Streptococcus dysgalactiae
	subsp. equisimilis (group G streptococcus [GGS]), a bacterium commonly
	found in the throat and skin of humans. ICESde3396 is 64 kb in size
	and encodes 66 putative open reading frames. ICESde3396 shares 38
	open reading frames with a putative ICE from Streptococcus agalactiae
	(group B streptococcus [GBS]), ICESa2603. In addition to genes involves
	in conjugal processes, ICESde3396 also carries genes predicted to
	be involved in virulence and resistance to various metals. A major
	feature of ICESde3396 differentiating it from ICESa2603 is the presence
	of an 18-kb internal recombinogenic region containing four unique
	gene clusters, which appear to have been acquired from streptococcal
	and nonstreptococcal bacterial species. The four clusters include
	two cadmium resistance operons, an arsenic resistance operon, and
	genes with orthologues in a group A streptococcus (GAS) prophage.
	Streptococci that naturally harbor ICESde3396 have increased resistance
	to cadmium and arsenate, indicating the functionality of genes present
	in the 18-kb recombinogenic region. By marking ICESde3396 with a
	kanamycin resistance gene, we demonstrate that the ICE is transferable

	presence of the ICE in clinical streptococcal isolates, we screened
	69 isolates (30 GGS, 19 GBS, and 20 GAS isolates) for the presence
	of three separate regions of ICESde3396. Eleven isolates possessed
	all three regions, suggesting they harbored ICESde3396-like elements.
	Another four isolates possessed ICESa2603-like elements. We propose
	that ICESde3396 is a mobile genetic element that is capable of acquiring
	DNA from multiple bacterial sources and is a vehicle for dissemination
	of this DNA through the wider beta-hemolytic streptococcal population.},

	for determining prokaryotic phylogeny. Phylogeny is currently the
	basis for prokaryotic systematics. Therefore, the validity of 16S
	rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analyses is of fundamental importance
	for prokaryotic systematics. Discrepancies between 16S rRNA gene
	analyses and DNA-DNA hybridization and phenotypic analyses have been
	noted in the genus Helicobacter. To clarify these discrepancies,
	we sequenced the 23S rRNA genes for 55 helicobacter strains representing
	41 taxa (>2,700 bases per sequence). Phylogenetic-tree construction
	using neighbor-joining, parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods
	for 23S rRNA gene sequence data yielded stable trees which were consistent
	with other phenotypic and genotypic methods. The 16S rRNA gene sequence-derived
	trees were discordant with the 23S rRNA gene trees and other data.
	Discrepant 16S rRNA gene sequence data for the helicobacters are
	consistent with the horizontal transfer of 16S rRNA gene fragments
	and the creation of mosaic molecules with loss of phylogenetic information.
	These results suggest that taxonomic decisions must be supported
	by other phylogenetically informative macromolecules, such as the
	23S rRNA gene, when 16S rRNA gene-derived phylogeny is discordant
	with other credible phenotypic and genotypic methods. This study
	found Wolinella succinogenes to branch with the unsheathed-flagellum
	cluster of helicobacters by 23S rRNA gene analyses and whole-genome
	comparisons. This study also found intervening sequences (IVSs) in
	the 23S rRNA genes of strains of 12 Helicobacter species. IVSs were

	gene transfer observable as abrupt switching in local homology. In
	addition to the resulting mosaic genome structure, they frequently

	Our method is based on the lengths of exact matches between pairs
	of sequences. Long matches indicate close homology, short matches

  abstract = {Cis-regulatory sequences are not always conserved across species.
	Divergence within cis-regulatory sequences may result from the evolution
	of species-specific patterns of gene expression or the flexible nature
	of the cis-regulatory code. The identification of functional divergence
	in cis-regulatory sequences is therefore important for both understanding
	the role of gene regulation in evolution and annotating regulatory
	elements. We have developed an evolutionary model to detect the loss
	of constraint on individual transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs).
	We find that a significant fraction of functionally constrained binding
	sites have been lost in a lineage-specific manner among three closely
	related yeast species. Binding site loss has previously been explained
	by turnover, where the concurrent gain and loss of a binding site
	maintains gene regulation. We estimate that nearly half of all loss
	events cannot be explained by binding site turnover. Recreating the
	mutations that led to binding site loss confirms that these sequence
	changes affect gene expression in some cases. We also estimate that
	there is a high rate of binding site gain, as more than half of experimentally
	identified S. cerevisiae binding sites are not conserved across species.
	The frequent gain and loss of TFBSs implies that cis-regulatory sequences
	are labile and, in the absence of turnover, may contribute to species-specific

  abstract = {Background. Inferring an evolutionary scenario for a gene family is
	a fundamental problem both in functional and evolutionary genomics.
	The gene tree/species tree reconciliation approach has been widely
	used to address this problem, but mostly in a parsimony framework,
	that considers only the reconciliation that minimizes the number
	of duplication and/or loss events. Recently a probabilistic approach
	has been developed, based on the classical birth-death process, including
	efficient algorithms for computing posterior probabilities of reconciliations
	and orthology prediction. Results.We recently proposed an efficient
	algorithm for exploring the whole space of gene tree/species tree
	reconciliations, that we adapt here to compute efficiently, either
	exactly or approximately depending on the space size, the posterior
	probability of the visited reconciliations.We use this algorithm
	to analyze the probabilistic landscape of the space of reconciliations
	for, both, a real dataset of fungal gene families and simulated data.
	Conclusion. Our results suggest that with realistic gene duplication
	and loss rates, a very small subset of all reconciliations needs
	to be explored in order to approximate very closely the posterior
	probability of the most likely reconciliations. For cases where the
	posterior probability mass is more evenly dispersed, our method allows
	to explore efficiently the required subspace of reconciliations.},

  pages = {682--689},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {Multiple sequence alignments have become one of the most commonly
	used resources in genomics research. Most algorithms for multiple
	alignment of whole genomes rely either on a reference genome, against
	which all of the other sequences are laid out, or require a one-to-one
	mapping between the nucleotides of the genomes, preventing the alignment
	of recently duplicated regions. Both approaches have drawbacks for
	whole-genome comparisons. In this paper we present a novel symmetric
	alignment algorithm. The resulting alignments not only represent
	all of the genomes equally well, but also include all relevant duplications
	that occurred since the divergence from the last common ancestor.
	Our algorithm, implemented as a part of the VISTA Genome Pipeline
	(VGP), was used to align seven vertebrate and six Drosophila genomes.
	The resulting whole-genome alignments demonstrate a higher sensitivity
	and specificity than the pairwise alignments previously available
	through the VGP and have higher exon alignment accuracy than comparable
	public whole-genome alignments. Of the multiple alignment methods
	tested, ours performed the best at aligning genes from multigene
	families-perhaps the most challenging test for whole-genome alignments.
	Our whole-genome multiple alignments are available through the VISTA

	20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases was examined. Although LGTs were common
	in the evolution of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, they were not
	sufficient to obscure the organismal phylogeny. Moreover, much of
	the apparent complexity of the gene tree was consistent with the
	formation of the paralogs in the ancestors to the modern lineages

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome sequence alignments form the basis of much research.
	Genome alignment depends on various mundane but critical choices,
	such as how to mask repeats and which score parameters to use. Surprisingly,
	there has been no large-scale assessment of these choices using real
	genomic data. Moreover, rigorous procedures to control the rate of
	spurious alignment have not been employed. RESULTS: We have assessed
	495 combinations of score parameters for alignment of animal, plant,
	and fungal genomes. As our gold-standard of accuracy, we used genome
	alignments implied by multiple alignments of proteins and of structural
	RNAs. We found the HOXD scoring schemes underlying alignments in
	the UCSC genome database to be far from optimal, and suggest better
	parameters. Higher values of the X-drop parameter are not always
	better. E-values accurately indicate the rate of spurious alignment,
	but only if tandem repeats are masked in a non-standard way. Finally,
	we show that gamma-centroid (probabilistic) alignment can find highly
	reliable subsets of aligned bases. CONCLUSIONS: These results enable
	more accurate genome alignment, with reliability measures for local
	alignments and for individual aligned bases. This study was made
	possible by our new software, LAST, which can align vertebrate genomes

	I introduce a Markov model of genome evolution with HGT, accounting

	sequence data sets with or without HGT. The consequences of HGT on

	robust to HGT, keeping high levels of performance even when gene
	trees are largely incongruent with each other. Gene tree incongruence
	per se is not indicative of HGT. HGT, however, removes the (otherwise
	observed) positive relationship between sequence length and gene
	tree congruence to the estimated species tree. Surprisingly, when

	acquisition of genes that evolved under the functional constraints

	has different components and circuits poses an evolutionary challenge.
	Moreover, genes belonging to complex modules in the pretransfer species
	are unlikely to maintain their functionality when transferred alone
	to new species. Thus, it is widely accepted that lateral gene transfer
	favors proteins with only a few protein-protein interactions. The
	propensity of proteins to participate in protein-protein interactions
	can be assessed using computational methods that identify putative
	interaction sites on the protein. Here we report that laterally acquired
	proteins contain significantly more putative interaction sites than
	native proteins. Thus, genes encoding proteins with multiple protein-protein
	interactions may in fact be more prone to transfer than genes with
	fewer interactions. We suggest that these proteins have a greater
	chance of forming new interactions in new species, thus integrating
	into existing modules. These results reveal basic principles for
	the incorporation of novel genes into existing systems.},

	Pathogenicity islands comprise large genomic regions [10-200 kilobases

  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {476},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has allowed bacteria to
	evolve many new capabilities. Because transferred genes perform many
	medically important functions, such as conferring antibiotic resistance,
	improved detection of horizontally transferred genes from sequence
	data would be an important advance. Existing sequence-based methods
	for detecting HGT focus on changes in nucleotide composition or on
	differences between gene and genome phylogenies; these methods have
	high error rates. RESULTS: First, we introduce a new class of methods
	for detecting HGT based on the changes in nucleotide substitution
	rates that occur when a gene is transferred to a new organism. Our
	new methods discriminate simulated HGT events with an error rate
	up to 10 times lower than does GC content. Use of models that are
	not time-reversible is crucial for detecting HGT. Second, we show
	that using combinations of multiple predictors of HGT offers substantial
	improvements over using any single predictor, yielding as much as
	a factor of 18 improvement in performance (a maximum reduction in
	error rate from 38\% to about 3\%). Multiple predictors were combined
	by using the random forests machine learning algorithm to identify
	optimal classifiers that separate HGT from non-HGT trees. CONCLUSION:
	The new class of HGT-detection methods introduced here combines advantages
	of phylogenetic and compositional HGT-detection techniques. These
	new techniques offer order-of-magnitude improvements over compositional
	methods because they are better able to discriminate HGT from non-HGT
	trees under a wide range of simulated conditions. We also found that
	combining multiple measures of HGT is essential for detecting a wide
	range of HGT events. These novel indicators of horizontal transfer
	will be widely useful in detecting HGT events linked to the evolution
	of important bacterial traits, such as antibiotic resistance and
	pathogenicity.},

	genome evolution.},

  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {235},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large scale genome arrangement, such as whole gene insertion/deletion,
	plays an important role in bacterial genome evolution. Various methods
	have been employed to study the dynamic process of gene insertions
	and deletions, such as parsimony methods and maximum likelihood methods.
	Previous maximum likelihood studies have assumed that the rate of
	gene insertions/deletions is constant over different genes. This
	assumption is unrealistic. For instance, it has been shown that informational
	genes are less likely to be laterally transferred than non-informational
	genes. However, how much of the variation in gene transfer rates
	is due to the difference between informational genes and non-informational
	genes is unclear. In this study, a Gamma-distribution was incorporated
	in the likelihood estimation by considering rate variation for gene
	insertions/deletions between genes. This makes it possible to address
	whether a difference between informational genes and non-informational
	genes is the main contributor to rate variation of lateral gene transfers.
	RESULTS: The results show that models incorporating rate variation
	fit the data better than do constant rate models in many phylogenetic
	groups. Even though informational genes are less likely to be laterally
	transferred than non-informational genes, the degree of rate variation
	for insertions/deletions did not change dramatically and remained
	high even when informational genes were excluded from the study.
	This suggests that the variation in rate of insertions/deletions
	is not due mainly to the simple difference between informational
	genes and non-informational genes. Among genes that are not classified

	pigs and can occasionally cause serious infections in humans. S.
	suis infections occur sporadically in human Europe and North America,
	but a recent major outbreak has been described in China with high
	levels of mortality. The mechanisms of S. suis pathogenesis in humans
	and pigs are poorly understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The
	sequencing of whole genomes of S. suis isolates provides opportunities
	to investigate the genetic basis of infection. Here we describe whole
	genome sequences of three S. suis strains from the same lineage:
	one from European pigs, and two from human cases from China and Vietnam.
	Comparative genomic analysis was used to investigate the variability
	of these strains. S. suis is phylogenetically distinct from other
	Streptococcus species for which genome sequences are currently available.
	Accordingly, approximately 40\% of the approximately 2 Mb genome
	is unique in comparison to other Streptococcus species. Finer genomic
	comparisons within the species showed a high level of sequence conservation;
	virtually all of the genome is common to the S. suis strains. The
	only exceptions are three approximately 90 kb regions, present in
	the two isolates from humans, composed of integrative conjugative
	elements and transposons. Carried in these regions are coding sequences
	associated with drug resistance. In addition, small-scale sequence
	variation has generated pseudogenes in putative virulence and colonization
	factors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The genomic inventories of genetically
	related S. suis strains, isolated from distinct hosts and diseases,
	exhibit high levels of conservation. However, the genomes provide
	evidence that horizontal gene transfer has contributed to the evolution
	of drug resistance.},

	fundamental in studying the evolution of genomes and biological systems.
	To reconstruct plausible evolutionary history, rates of gene gain/loss

	e.g. genome duplication and parasitization, respectively, result
	in high rates of gene gain and loss. Gene-content evolution reconstruction
	methods that consider this heterogeneity and that are both effective
	in estimating the rates of gene gain and loss and sufficiently efficient
	to analyze abundant genomic data had not been developed. RESULTS:
	An effective and efficient method for reconstructing heterogeneous
	gene-content evolution was developed. This method comprises analytically
	integrable modeling of gene-content evolution, analytical formulation
	of expectation-maximization and efficient calculation of marginal
	likelihood using an inside-outside-like algorithm. Simulation tests
	on the scale of hundreds of genomes showed that both the gene gain/loss

	a few days of computational time. Subsequently, this algorithm was
	applied to an actual data set of nearly 200 genomes to reconstruct
	the heterogeneous gene-content evolution across the three domains
	of life. The reconstructed history, which contained several features
	consistent with biological observations, showed that the trends of
	gene-content evolution were not only drastically different between
	prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but were highly variable within each
	form of life. The results suggest that heterogeneity should be considered

  abstract = {The taxonomic status and structure of Streptococcus dysgalactiae have
	been the object of much confusion. Bacteria belonging to this species
	are usually referred to as Lancefield group C or group G streptococci
	in clinical settings in spite of the fact that these terms lack precision
	and prevent recognition of the exact clinical relevance of these
	bacteria. The purpose of this study was to develop an improved basis
	for delineation and identification of the individual species of the
	pyogenic group of streptococci in the clinical microbiology laboratory,
	with a special focus on S. dysgalactiae. We critically reexamined
	the genetic relationships of the species S. dysgalactiae, Streptococcus
	pyogenes, Streptococcus canis, and Streptococcus equi, which may
	share Lancefield group antigens, by phylogenetic reconstruction based
	on multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and 16S rRNA gene sequences
	and by emm typing combined with phenotypic characterization. Analysis
	of concatenated sequences of seven genes previously used for examination
	of viridans streptococci distinguished robust and coherent clusters.
	S. dysgalactiae consists of two separate clusters consistent with
	the two recognized subspecies dysgalactiae and equisimilis. Both
	taxa share alleles with S. pyogenes in several housekeeping genes,
	which invalidates identification based on single-locus sequencing.
	S. dysgalactiae, S. canis, and S. pyogenes constitute a closely related
	branch within the genus Streptococcus indicative of recent descent
	from a common ancestor, while S. equi is highly divergent from other
	species of the pyogenic group streptococci. The results provide an
	improved basis for identification of clinically important pyogenic
	group streptococci and explain the overlapping spectrum of infections
	caused by the species associated with humans.},

  abstract = {The molecular mechanisms underlying niche adaptation in bacteria are
	not fully understood. Primary infection by the pathogen group A streptococcus
	(GAS) takes place at either the throat or the skin of its human host,
	and GAS strains differ in tissue site preference. Many skin-tropic
	strains bind host plasminogen via the plasminogen-binding group A
	streptococcal M protein (PAM) present on the cell surface; inactivation
	of genes encoding either PAM or streptokinase (a plasminogen activator)
	leads to loss of virulence at the skin. Unlike PAM, which is present
	in only a subset of GAS strains, the gene encoding streptokinase
	(ska) is present in all GAS isolates. In this study, the evolution
	of the virulence genes known to be involved in skin infection was
	examined. Most genetic diversity within ska genes was localized to
	a region encoding the plasminogen-docking domain (beta-domain). The
	gene encoding PAM displayed strong linkage disequilibrium (P << 0.01)
	with a distinct phylogenetic cluster of the ska beta-domain-encoding
	region. Yet, ska alleles of distant taxa showed a history of intragenic
	recombination, and high intrinsic levels of recombination were found
	among GAS strains having different tissue tropisms. The data suggest
	that tissue-specific adaptations arise from epistatic coselection
	of bacterial virulence genes. Additional analysis of ska genes showed
	that approximately 4\% of the codons underwent strong diversifying
	selection. Horizontal acquisition of one ska lineage from a commensal
	Streptococcus donor species was also evident. Together, the data
	suggest that new phenotypes can be acquired through interspecies
	recombination between orthologous genes, while constrained functions
	can be preserved; in this way, orthologous genes may provide a rich
	and ready source for new phenotypes and thereby play a facilitating
	role in the emergence of new niche adaptations in bacteria.},

	method consists of two stages. In the first stage, a sliding window
	is moved along the DNA sequence alignment, and phylogenetic trees
	are sampled from the conditional posterior distribution with MCMC.
	To reduce the noise intrinsic to inference from the limited amount
	of data available in the typically short sliding window, a clustering
	algorithm based on the Robinson-Foulds distance is applied to the
	trees thus sampled, and the posterior distribution over tree clusters
	is obtained for each window position. While changes in this posterior
	distribution are indicative of recombination or gene conversion events,
	it is difficult to decide when such a change is statistically significant.
	This problem is addressed in the second stage of the proposed algorithm,
	where the distributions obtained in the first stage are post-processed
	with a Bayesian hidden Markov model (HMM). The emission states of
	the HMM are associated with posterior distributions over phylogenetic
	tree topology clusters. The hidden states of the HMM indicate putative
	recombinant segments. Inference is done in a Bayesian sense, sampling
	parameters from the posterior distribution with MCMC. Of particular
	interest is the determination of the number of hidden states as an
	indication of the number of putative recombinant regions. To this
	end, we apply reversible jump MCMC, and sample the number of hidden
	states from the respective posterior distribution.},

  abstract = {Prochlorococcus is a marine cyanobacterium that numerically dominates
	the mid-latitude oceans and is the smallest known oxygenic phototroph.
	Numerous isolates from diverse areas of the world's oceans have been
	studied and shown to be physiologically and genetically distinct.
	All isolates described thus far can be assigned to either a tightly
	clustered high-light (HL)-adapted clade, or a more divergent low-light
	(LL)-adapted group. The 16S rRNA sequences of the entire Prochlorococcus
	group differ by at most 3\%, and the four initially published genomes
	revealed patterns of genetic differentiation that help explain physiological
	differences among the isolates. Here we describe the genomes of eight
	newly sequenced isolates and combine them with the first four genomes
	for a comprehensive analysis of the core (shared by all isolates)
	and flexible genes of the Prochlorococcus group, and the patterns
	of loss and gain of the flexible genes over the course of evolution.
	There are 1,273 genes that represent the core shared by all 12 genomes.
	They are apparently sufficient, according to metabolic reconstruction,
	to encode a functional cell. We describe a phylogeny for all 12 isolates
	by subjecting their complete proteomes to three different phylogenetic
	analyses. For each non-core gene, we used a maximum parsimony method
	to estimate which ancestor likely first acquired or lost each gene.
	Many of the genetic differences among isolates, especially for genes
	involved in outer membrane synthesis and nutrient transport, are
	found within the same clade. Nevertheless, we identified some genes
	defining HL and LL ecotypes, and clades within these broad ecotypes,
	helping to demonstrate the basis of HL and LL adaptations in Prochlorococcus.
	Furthermore, our estimates of gene gain events allow us to identify
	highly variable genomic islands that are not apparent through simple
	pairwise comparisons. These results emphasize the functional roles,
	especially those connected to outer membrane synthesis and transport
	that dominate the flexible genome and set it apart from the core.
	Besides identifying islands and demonstrating their role throughout
	the history of Prochlorococcus, reconstruction of past gene gains
	and losses shows that much of the variability exists at the "leaves
	of the tree," between the most closely related strains. Finally,
	the identification of core and flexible genes from this 12-genome
	comparison is largely consistent with the relative frequency of Prochlorococcus
	genes found in global ocean metagenomic databases, further closing
	the gap between our understanding of these organisms in the lab and
	the wild.},

	seem to have exchanged genes with archaea to a greater extent than
	other bacteria, whereas transfer of certain classes of eukaryotic
	genes is most common in parasitic and symbiotic bacteria. Horizontal
	transfer events can be classified into distinct categories of acquisition

	of genome sequencing was established, with a doubling time of approximately
	20 months for bacteria and approximately 34 months for archaea. Comparative
	analysis of the hundreds of sequenced bacterial and dozens of archaeal

	resulting in genome contraction. A crucial component of the prokaryotic
	world is the mobilome, the enormous collection of viruses, plasmids

	The evolution of recombinant sequences can not be properly explained

	We developed a likelihood-based model selection procedure that uses
	a genetic algorithm to search multiple sequence alignments for evidence
	of recombination breakpoints and identify putative recombinant sequences.
	GARD is an extensible and intuitive method that can be run efficiently
	in parallel. Extensive simulation studies show that the method nearly
	always outperforms other available tools, both in terms of power
	and accuracy and that the use of GARD to screen sequences for recombination

	Mitochondrial genome arrangements may be especially informative about
	metazoan evolutionary relationships because (1) nearly all animals
	have the same set of definitively homologous mitochondrial genes,
	(2) mitochondrial genome rearrangement events are rare relative to
	changes in sequences, and (3) the number of possible mitochondrial
	genome arrangements is huge, making convergent evolution of genome
	arrangements appear highly unlikely. In previous studies, phylogenetic
	evidence in genome arrangement data is nearly always used in a qualitative
	fashion-the support in favor of clades with similar or identical
	genome arrangements is considered to be quite strong, but is not
	quantified. The purpose of this article is to quantify the uncertainty
	among the relationships of metazoan phyla on the basis of mitochondrial
	genome arrangements while incorporating prior knowledge of the monophyly
	of various groups from other sources. The work we present here differs
	from our previous work in the statistics literature in that (1) we
	incorporate prior information on classifications of metazoans at
	the phylum level, (2) we describe several advances in our computational
	approach, and (3) we analyze a much larger data set (87 taxa) that
	consists of each unique, complete mitochondrial genome arrangement
	with a full complement of 37 genes that were present in the NCBI
	(National Center for Biotechnology Information) database at a recent
	date. In addition, we analyze a subset of 28 of these 87 taxa for

	of our inversion-only model of rearrangement is more plausible. We

	to 37\% of the core-genome judged to be recombinant), while positive
	selection was mainly observed during species differentiation (from
	11\% to 34\% of the core-genome). Positive selection pressure was
	unevenly distributed across lineages and biochemical main role categories.
	S. suis was the lineage with the greatest level of positive selection
	pressure, the largest number of unique loci selected, and the largest
	amount of gene gain and loss. CONCLUSION: Recombination is an important
	evolutionary force in shaping Streptococcus genomes, not only in
	the acquisition of significant portions of the genome as lineage
	specific loci, but also in facilitating rapid evolution of the core-genome.
	Positive selection, although undoubtedly a slower process, has nonetheless
	played an important role in adaptation of the core-genome of different
	Streptococcus species to different hosts.},

	provides a scalable method for constructing orthologous groups across
	multiple eukaryotic taxa, using a Markov Cluster algorithm to group
	(putative) orthologs and paralogs. This method performs similarly
	to the INPARANOID algorithm when applied to two genomes, but can
	be extended to cluster orthologs from multiple species. OrthoMCL
	clusters are coherent with groups identified by EGO, but improved
	recognition of "recent" paralogs permits overlapping EGO groups representing
	the same gene to be merged. Comparison with previously assigned EC
	annotations suggests a high degree of reliability, implying utility
	for automated eukaryotic genome annotation. OrthoMCL has been applied
	to the proteome data set from seven publicly available genomes (human,

	the problem of inferring indel rates between pairs of divergent sequence

	RESULTS: Simulations suggest that new method for estimating indel
	rates is accurate to within 2\%, at divergences corresponding to
	that of human and mouse. Applying the method to these species, I
	show that indel rates are up to twice higher than is apparent from
	alignments, and depend strongly on the local G + C content. These
	results indicate that at these evolutionary distances, the contribution
	of indels to sequence divergence is much larger than hitherto appreciated.
	In particular, the ratio of substitution to indel rates between human
	and mouse appears to be around gamma = 8, rather than the currently
	accepted value of about gamma = 14.},

	Here, we report the genome sequences of nine environmentally adapted

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis (SDSE)
	is an emerging global pathogen that can colonize and infect humans.
	Although most SDSE isolates possess the Lancefield group G carbohydrate,
	a significant minority have the group C carbohydrate. Isolates are
	further sub-typed on the basis of differences within the emm gene.
	To gain a better understanding of their molecular epidemiology and
	evolutionary relationships, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis
	was performed on SDSE isolates collected from Australia, Europe and
	North America. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The 178 SDSE isolates,
	representing 37 emm types, segregate into 80 distinct sequence types
	(STs) that form 17 clonal complexes (CCs). Eight STs recovered from
	all three continents account for >50\% of the isolates. Thus, a small
	number of STs are highly prevalent and have a wide geographic distribution.
	Both ST and CC strongly correlate with group carbohydrate. In contrast,
	eleven STs were associated with >1 emm type, suggestive of recombinational
	replacements involving the emm gene; furthermore, 35\% of the emm
	types are associated with genetically distant STs. Data also reveal
	a history of extensive inter- and intra-species recombination involving
	the housekeeping genes used for MLST. Sequence analysis of single
	locus variants identified through goeBURST indicates that genetic
	change mediated by recombination occurred approximately 4.4 times
	more frequently than by point mutation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
	A few genetic lineages with an intercontinental distribution dominate
	among SDSE causing infections in humans. The distinction between
	group C and G isolates reflects recent evolution, and no long-term
	genetic isolation between them was found. Lateral gene transfer and
	recombination involving housekeeping genes and the emm gene are important
	mechanisms driving genetic variability in the SDSE population.},

  abstract = {The 1,815,783-bp genome of a serotype M49 strain of Streptococcus
	pyogenes (group A streptococcus [GAS]), strain NZ131, has been determined.
	This GAS strain (FCT type 3; emm pattern E), originally isolated
	from a case of acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, is unusually
	competent for electrotransformation and has been used extensively
	as a model organism for both basic genetic and pathogenesis investigations.
	As with the previously sequenced S. pyogenes genomes, three unique
	prophages are a major source of genetic diversity. Two clustered
	regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) regions were
	present in the genome, providing genetic information on previous
	prophage encounters. A unique cluster of genes was found in the pathogenicity
	island-like emm region that included a novel Nudix hydrolase, and,
	further, this cluster appears to be specific for serotype M49 and
	M82 strains. Nudix hydrolases eliminate potentially hazardous materials
	or prevent the unbalanced accumulation of normal metabolites; in
	bacteria, these enzymes may play a role in host cell invasion. Since
	M49 S. pyogenes strains have been known to be associated with skin
	infections, the Nudix hydrolase and its associated genes may have
	a role in facilitating survival in an environment that is more variable
	and unpredictable than the uniform warmth and moisture of the throat.
	The genome of NZ131 continues to shed light upon the evolutionary
	history of this human pathogen. Apparent horizontal transfer of genetic
	material has led to the existence of highly variable virulence-associated
	regions that are marked by multiple rearrangements and genetic diversification
	while other regions, even those associated with virulence, vary little
	between genomes. The genome regions that encode surface gene products
	that will interact with host targets or aid in immune avoidance are
	the ones that display the most sequence diversity. Thus, while natural
	selection favors stability in much of the genome, it favors diversity
	in these regions.},

	different rates, and it is not clear how to weight them in a distance
	based approach. RESULTS: We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
	method to genome rearrangement based on a stochastic model of evolution,
	which can estimate the number of different evolutionary events needed
	to sort a signed permutation. The performance of the method was tested
	on simulated data, and the estimated numbers of different types of

	estimate. No deterministic polynomial algorithm is known to count
	the number of optimal sorting paths nor sample from the uniform distribution

	we sequenced the genome of serotype M3 strain SSI-1, isolated from
	an STSS patient in Japan, and compared it with those of other GAS
	strains. The SSI-1 genome is composed of 1,884,275 bp, and 1.7 Mb
	of the sequence is highly conserved relative to strain SF370 (serotype
	M1) and MGAS8232 (serotype M18), and almost completely conserved
	relative to strain MGAS315 (serotype M3). However, a large genomic
	rearrangement has been shown to occur across the replication axis
	between the homologous rrn-comX1 regions and between two prophage-coding
	regions across the replication axis. Atotal of 1 Mb of chromosomal
	DNA is inverted across the replication axis. Interestingly, the recombinations

	The success of these intergenomic transfers depends upon the successful

	Statistical analyses of extant M. tuberculosis minisatellite data

	and genetic analyses suggest that tiny M. tuberculosis populations
	persisted for ∼100 y among indigenous populations and subsequently

	are sustained by ongoing migration and slow disease dynamics, and
	(ii) expansion of the M. tuberculosis population facilitated by shifts

	Bayesian methods offer important advantages. In particular, the latter

	the estimation of phylogenies and model parameters using all available

	mechanisms of cells against oxidative stress and hence play a role
	in the pathogenesis of certain bacteria. We previously demonstrated
	that group B streptococci (GBS) possess a single Mn-cofactored superoxide
	dismutase (SodA). To analyze the role of this enzyme in the pathogenicity
	of GBS, we constructed a sodA-disrupted mutant of Streptococcus agalactiae
	NEM316 by allelic exchange. This mutant was subsequently cis complemented
	by integration into the chromosome of pAT113/Sp harboring the wild-type
	sodA gene. The SOD specific activity detected by gel analysis in
	cell extracts confirmed that active SODs were present in the parental
	and complemented strains but absent in the sodA mutant. The growth
	rates of these strains in standing cultures were comparable, but
	the sodA mutant was extremely susceptible to the oxidative stress
	generated by addition of paraquat or hydrogen peroxide to the culture
	medium and exhibited a higher mutation frequency in the presence
	of rifampin. In mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages, the sodA mutant
	showed an increased susceptibility to bacterial killing by macrophages.
	In a mouse infection model, after intravenous injection the survival
	of the sodA mutant in the blood and the brain was markedly reduced
	in comparison to that of the parental and complemented strains whereas
	only minor effects on survival in the liver and the spleen were observed.
	These results suggest that SodA plays a role in GBS pathogenesis.},

	(TOL) should be replaced by a "net of life" as the paradigm of prokaryote
	evolution. However, trees remain the natural representation of the
	histories of individual genes given the fundamentally bifurcating
	process of gene replication. Therefore, although no single tree can
	fully represent the evolution of prokaryote genomes, the complete
	picture of evolution will necessarily combine trees and nets. A quantitative
	measure of the signals of tree and net evolution is derived from
	an analysis of all quartets of species in all trees of the "Forest
	of Life" (FOL), which consists of approximately 7,000 phylogenetic
	trees for prokaryote genes including approximately 100 nearly universal
	trees (NUTs). Although diverse routes of net-like evolution collectively
	dominate the FOL, the pattern of tree-like evolution that reflects
	the consistent topologies of the NUTs is the most prominent coherent
	trend. We show that the contributions of tree-like and net-like evolutionary
	processes substantially differ across bacterial and archaeal lineages

  abstract = {Perhaps the most-surprising discovery of the genome era has been the
	extent to which prokaryotic and many eukaryotic genomes incorporate
	genetic material from sources other than their parent(s). Lateral
	genetic transfer (LGT) among bacteria was first observed about 100
	years ago, and is now accepted to underlie important phenomena including
	the spread of antibiotic resistance and ability to degrade xenobiotics.
	LGT is invoked, perhaps too readily, to explain a breadth of awkward
	data including compositional heterogeneity of genomes, disagreement
	among gene-sequence trees, and mismatch between physiology and systematics.
	At the same time many details of LGT remain unknown or controversial,
	and some key questions have scarcely been asked. Here I critically
	review what we think we know about the existence, extent, mechanism
	and impact of LGT; identify important open questions; and point to
	research directions that hold particular promise for elucidating
	the role of LGT in genome evolution. Evidence for LGT in nature is
	not only inferential but also direct, and potential vectors are ubiquitous.
	Genetic material can pass between diverse habitats and be significantly
	altered during residency in viruses, complicating the inference of
	donors, In prokaryotes about twice as many genes are interrupted
	by LGT as are transferred intact, and about 5Short protein domains
	can be privileged units of transfer. Unresolved phylogenetic issues
	include the correct null hypothesis, and genes as units of analysis.
	Themes are beginning to emerge regarding the effect of LGT on cellular
	networks, but I show why generalization is premature. LGT can associate
	with radical changes in physiology and ecological niche. Better quantitative
	models of genome evolution are needed, and theoretical frameworks

  title = {On origin of genetic code and tRNA before translation.},
  journal = {Biol Direct},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {14},
  abstract = {ABSTRACT:Synthesis of proteins is based on the genetic code - a nearly
	universal assignment of codons to amino acids (aas). A major challenge
	to the understanding of the origins of this assignment is the archetypal
	"key-lock vs. frozen accident" dilemma. Here we re-examine this dilemma
	in light of 1) the fundamental veto on "foresight evolution", 2)
	modular structures of tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and 3)
	the updated library of aa-binding sites in RNA aptamers successfully
	selected in vitro for eight amino acids.The aa-binding sites of arginine,
	isoleucine and tyrosine contain both their cognate triplets, anticodons
	and codons. We have noticed that these cases might be associated
	with palindrome-dinucleotides. For example, one-base shift to the
	left brings arginine codons CGN, with CG at 1-2 positions, to the
	respective anticodons NCG, with CG at 2-3 positions. Formally, the
	concomitant presence of codons and anticodons is also expected in
	the reverse situation, with codons containing palindrome-dinucleotides
	at their 2-3 positions, and anticodons exhibiting them at 1-2 positions.
	A closer analysis reveals that, surprisingly, RNA binding sites for
	Arg, Ile and Tyr "prefer" (exactly as in the actual genetic code)
	the anticodon(2-3)/codon(1-2) tetramers to their anticodon(1-2)/codon(2-3)
	counterparts, despite the seemingly perfect symmetry of the latter.
	However, since in vitro selection of aa-specific RNA aptamers apparently
	had nothing to do with translation, this striking preference provides
	a new strong support to the notion of the genetic code emerging before
	translation, in response to catalytic (and possibly other) needs
	of ancient RNA life. Consistently with the pre-translation origin
	of the code, we propose here a new model of tRNA origin by the gradual,
	Fibonacci process-like, elongation of a tRNA molecule from a primordial
	coding triplet and 5'DCCA3' quadruplet (D is a base-determinator)
	to the eventual 76 base-long cloverleaf-shaped molecule.Taken together,
	our findings necessarily imply that primordial tRNAs, tRNA aminoacylating
	ribozymes, and (later) the translation machinery in general have
	been co-evolving to ''fit'' the (likely already defined) genetic
	code, rather than the opposite way around. Coding triplets in this
	primal pre-translational code were likely similar to the anticodons,
	with second and third nucleotides being more important than the less
	specific first one. Later, when the code was expanding in co-evolution
	with the translation apparatus, the importance of 2-3 nucleotides
	of coding triplets "transferred" to the 1-2 nucleotides of their
	complements, thus distinguishing anticodons from codons. This evolutionary
	primacy of anticodons in genetic coding makes the hypothesis of primal
	stereo-chemical affinity between amino acids and cognate triplets,
	the hypothesis of coding coenzyme handles for amino acids, the hypothesis
	of tRNA-like genomic 3' tags suggesting that tRNAs originated in
	replication, and the hypothesis of ancient ribozymes-mediated operational
	code of tRNA aminoacylation not mutually contradicting but rather
	co-existing in harmony.This article was reviewed by Eugene V. Koonin,

	pyrogenic exotoxins (spe) by hybridisation with probes that stand
	for the GAS genes speA, speC, speZ (smeZ), speH, speG, speI, speJ

	with the probes speG, speJ and ssa, but not with the probes for the

	sequence analysis of the PCR fragments revealed only the presence
	of the gene speG in GCS and GGS strains, while no DNA fragments specific
	for speJ and ssa could be amplified. Additionally, the upstream and
	downstream regions flanking speG in GGS strain 39072 were sequenced.
	Remarkable differences were found in the neighbourhood of speG between

  abstract = {While the premise that lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a dominant evolutionary
	force is still in considerable dispute, the case for widespread LGT
	in the family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) is no longer contentious.
	aaRSs are ancient enzymes, guarding the fidelity of the genetic code.
	They are clustered in two structurally unrelated classes. Only lysine
	aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) is found both as a class 1 and
	a class 2 enzyme (LysRS1-2). Remarkably, in several extant prokaryotes
	both classes of the enzyme coexist, a unique phenomenon that has
	yet to receive its due attention.We applied a phylogenetic approach
	for determining the extent and origin of LGT in prokaryotic LysRS.
	Reconstructing species trees for Archaea and Bacteria, and inferring
	that their last common ancestors encoded LysRS1 and LysRS2, respectively,
	we studied the gains and losses of both classes. A complex pattern
	of LGT events emerged. In specific groups of organisms LysRS1 was
	replaced by LysRS2 (and vice versa). In one occasion, within the
	alpha proteobacteria, a LysRS2 to LysRS1 LGT was followed by reversal
	to LysRS2. After establishing the most likely LGT paths, we studied
	the possible origins of the laterally transferred genes. To this
	end, we reconstructed LysRS gene trees and evaluated the likely origins
	of the laterally transferred genes. While the sources of LysRS1 LGTs
	were readily identified, those for LysRS2 remain, for now, uncertain.
	The replacement of one LysRS by another apparently transits through
	a stage simultaneously coding for both synthetases, probably conferring
	a selective advantage to the affected organisms.The family of LysRSs
	features complex LGT events. The currently available data were sufficient
	for identifying unambiguously the origins of LysRS1 but not of LysRS2
	gene transfers. A selective advantage is suggested to organisms encoding
	simultaneously LysRS1-2.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The Monte Carlo simulation of sequence evolution
	is routinely used to assess the performance of phylogenetic inference
	methods and sequence alignment algorithms. Progress in the field
	of molecular evolution fuels the need for more realistic and hence
	more complex simulations, adapted to particular situations, yet current
	software makes unreasonable assumptions such as homogeneous substitution
	dynamics or a uniform distribution of indels across the simulated
	sequences. This calls for an extensible simulation framework written
	in a high-level functional language, offering new functionality and
	making it easy to incorporate further complexity. RESULTS: PhyloSim
	is an extensible framework for the Monte Carlo simulation of sequence
	evolution, written in R, using the Gillespie algorithm to integrate
	the actions of many concurrent processes such as substitutions, insertions
	and deletions. Uniquely among sequence simulation tools, PhyloSim
	can simulate arbitrarily complex patterns of rate variation and multiple
	indel processes, and allows for the incorporation of selective constraints
	on indel events. User-defined complex patterns of mutation and selection
	can be easily integrated into simulations, allowing PhyloSim to be
	adapted to specific needs. CONCLUSIONS: Close integration with R
	and the wide range of features implemented offer unmatched flexibility,
	making it possible to simulate sequence evolution under a wide range
	of realistic settings. We believe that PhyloSim will be useful to
	future studies involving simulated alignments.},

	phylogeny constructed on the basis of gene content, rather than on
	sequence identity, of 13 completely sequenced genomes of unicellular
	species. The similarity between two species is defined as the number

	can be interpreted in terms of evolutionary events such as the acquisition

	can be interpreted in terms of function. As such, it takes a position
	intermediate to phylogenies based on single genes and phylogenies

	phylogeny is independent of phylogenies based on the level of sequence
	identity of individual genes, it correlates with the standard reference

	has been compromised because of the development of altered penicillin-binding
	proteins (PBPs), however, this has been less so for amoxicillin than
	for penicillin. Recently, there have been a number of important methods
	developed to detect molecular adaptation in protein coding genes.
	The purpose of this study is to employ modern molecular selection
	approaches to predict sites under positive selection pressure in
	PBPs, derived from a large international S. pneumoniae collection
	of amoxicillin resistant and susceptible isolates, and encompassing
	a comparative data set of 354 pbp1a, 335 pbp2b, and 389 pbp2x gene
	sequences. A correspondence discriminant analysis (CDA) of positively
	selected pbp sites and amoxicillin MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration)
	values is then used to detect sites under positive selection pressure
	that are important in discriminating different amoxicillin MICs.
	Molecular adaptation was evident throughout PBP2X, with numerous
	positively selected sites in both the transpeptidase (TP) and C-terminal
	domains, strongly correlated with discriminating amoxicillin MICs.
	In the case of PBP1A positive selection was present in the glycosyltransfer
	(GT), TP and C-terminal domains. Sites within the TP domain tended
	to be correlated with the discrimination of low from intermediate
	MICs, whereas sites within the C-terminal tail, with a discrimination
	of intermediate from fully resistant. Most of the positively selected
	sites within PBP2B were in the N-terminal domain and were not correlated
	with amoxicillin MICs, however, several sites taken from the literature
	for the TP domain were strongly associated with discriminating high
	from intermediate level amoxicillin resistance. Many of the positively
	selected sites could be directly associated with functional inferences
	based on the crystal structures of these proteins. Our results suggest
	that clinical emphasis on TP domain sequences of these proteins may
	result in missing information relevant to antibiotic resistance development.},

  abstract = {The universal common ancestry (UCA) of all known life is a fundamental
	component of modern evolutionary theory, supported by a wide range
	of qualitative molecular evidence. Nevertheless, recently both the
	status and nature of UCA has been questioned. In earlier work I presented
	a formal, quantitative test of UCA in which model selection criteria
	overwhelmingly choose common ancestry over independent ancestry,
	based on a dataset of universally conserved proteins. These model-based
	tests are founded in likelihoodist and Bayesian probability theory,
	in opposition to classical frequentist null hypothesis tests such
	as Karlin-Altschul E-values for sequence similarity. In a recent
	comment, Koonin and Wolf (K&W) claim that the model preference for
	UCA is "a trivial consequence of significant sequence similarity".
	They support this claim with a computational simulation, derived
	from universally conserved proteins, which produces similar sequences
	lacking phylogenetic structure. The model selection tests prefer
	common ancestry for this artificial data set.For the real universal
	protein sequences, hierarchical phylogenetic structure (induced by
	genealogical history) is the overriding reason for why the tests
	choose UCA; sequence similarity is a relatively minor factor. First,
	for cases of conflicting phylogenetic structure, the tests choose
	independent ancestry even with highly similar sequences. Second,
	certain models, like star trees and K&W's profile model (corresponding
	to their simulation), readily explain sequence similarity yet lack
	phylogenetic structure. However, these are extremely poor models
	for the real proteins, even worse than independent ancestry models,
	though they explain K&W's artificial data well. Finally, K&W's simulation
	is an implementation of a well-known phylogenetic model, and it produces
	sequences that mimic homologous proteins. Therefore the model selection
	tests work appropriately with the artificial data.For K&W's artificial
	protein data, sequence similarity is the predominant factor influencing
	the preference for common ancestry. In contrast, for the real proteins,
	model selection tests show that phylogenetic structure is much more
	important than sequence similarity. Hence, the model selection tests
	demonstrate that real universally conserved proteins are homologous,
	a conclusion based primarily on the specific nested patterns of correlations
	induced in genetically related protein sequences.This article was

  abstract = {Universal common ancestry (UCA) is a central pillar of modern evolutionary
	theory. As first suggested by Darwin, the theory of UCA posits that
	all extant terrestrial organisms share a common genetic heritage,
	each being the genealogical descendant of a single species from the
	distant past. The classic evidence for UCA, although massive, is
	largely restricted to 'local' common ancestry-for example, of specific
	phyla rather than the entirety of life-and has yet to fully integrate
	the recent advances from modern phylogenetics and probability theory.
	Although UCA is widely assumed, it has rarely been subjected to formal
	quantitative testing, and this has led to critical commentary emphasizing
	the intrinsic technical difficulties in empirically evaluating a
	theory of such broad scope. Furthermore, several researchers have
	proposed that early life was characterized by rampant horizontal
	gene transfer, leading some to question the monophyly of life. Here
	I provide the first, to my knowledge, formal, fundamental test of
	UCA, without assuming that sequence similarity implies genetic kinship.
	I test UCA by applying model selection theory to molecular phylogenies,
	focusing on a set of ubiquitously conserved proteins that are proposed
	to be orthologous. Among a wide range of biological models involving
	the independent ancestry of major taxonomic groups, the model selection
	tests are found to overwhelmingly support UCA irrespective of the
	presence of horizontal gene transfer and symbiotic fusion events.
	These results provide powerful statistical evidence corroborating
	the monophyly of all known life.},

  abstract = {All clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus)
	share the ability to resist phagocytosis and grow in human blood.
	In many strains, this property is due to the expression of a single
	antiphagocytic M protein, while other strains express more than one
	M-like molecule, of which the role in phagocytosis resistance is
	unclear. In particular, all S. pyogenes strains of the OF+ lineage,
	representing approximately half of all isolates, express two M-like
	proteins, Mrp and Emm, which are immunologically unrelated. These
	two proteins bind different ligands that have been implicated in
	phagocytosis resistance: Mrp binds fibrinogen and Emm binds the complement
	inhibitor C4BP. Using a clinical isolate of the common serotype 22,
	we created mutants affected in the mrp and emm genes and characterized
	them in phagocytosis experiments and by electron microscopy. A double
	mutant mrp-emm- showed strongly decreased resistance to phagocytosis,
	while mrp- and emm- single mutants grew well in blood. However, optimal
	growth required the expression of both Mrp and Emm. Experiments in
	which coagulation was inhibited using the specific thrombin inhibitor,
	hirudin, rather than heparin, indicated that Emm is more important
	than Mrp for resistance to phagocytosis. Tuftlike surface structures
	typical for S. pyogenes were still present in the mrp-emm- double
	mutant, but not in a mutant affected in the regulatory gene mga,
	indicating that the presence of these surface structures is not directly
	correlated to phagocytosis resistance. Our data imply that OF+ strains
	of S. pyogenes express two antiphagocytic M proteins with different
	ligand-binding properties.},

	evolve horizontally, from a copy of an alloacceptor tRNA gene in
	the same genome. Earlier, we provided the first unambiguous evidence
	for the occurrence of such "tRNA gene recruitment" in nature - in
	the mitochondrial (mt) genome of the demosponge Axinella corrugata.
	Yet the extent and the pattern of this process in the evolution of
	tRNA gene families remained unclear. Here we analyzed tRNA genes
	from 21 mt genomes of demosponges as well as nuclear genomes of rhesus
	macaque, chimpanzee and human. We found four new cases of alloacceptor
	tRNA gene recruitment in mt genomes and eleven cases in the nuclear
	genomes. In most of these cases we observed a single nucleotide substitution
	at the middle position of the anticodon, which resulted in the change
	of not only the tRNA's amino-acid identity but also the class of
	the amino-acyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) involved in amino-acylation.
	We hypothesize that the switch to a different class of aaRSs may
	have prevented the conflict between anticodon and amino-acid identities
	of recruited tRNAs. Overall our results suggest that gene recruitment
	is a common phenomenon in tRNA multigene family evolution and should
	be taken into consideration when tRNA evolutionary history is reconstructed.},

	complete genome sequence of S. uberis strain 0140J was undertaken
	to help elucidate the biology of this effective bovine pathogen.
	RESULTS: The genome revealed 1,825 predicted coding sequences (CDSs)
	of which 62 were identified as pseudogenes or gene fragments. Comparisons
	with related pyogenic streptococci identified a conserved core (40\%)
	of orthologous CDSs. Intriguingly, S. uberis 0140J displayed a lower
	number of mobile genetic elements when compared with other pyogenic
	streptococci, however bacteriophage-derived islands and a putative
	genomic island were identified. Comparative genomics analysis revealed
	most similarity to the genomes of Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus
	equi subsp. zooepidemicus. In contrast, streptococcal orthologs were
	not identified for 11\% of the CDSs, indicating either unique retention
	of ancestral sequence, or acquisition of sequence from alternative
	sources. Functions including transport, catabolism, regulation and
	CDSs encoding cell envelope proteins were over-represented in this
	unique gene set; a limited array of putative virulence CDSs were
	identified. CONCLUSION: S. uberis utilises nutritional flexibility
	derived from a diversity of metabolic options to successfully occupy
	a discrete ecological niche. The features observed in S. uberis are
	strongly suggestive of an opportunistic pathogen adapted to challenging

  abstract = {Two-component systems (TCSs) are diverse and abundant signal transduction
	pathways found predominantly in prokaryotes. This review focuses
	on insights into TCS evolution made possible by the sequencing of
	whole prokaryotic genomes. Typical TCSs comprise an autophosphorylating
	protein (a histidine kinase), which transfers a phosphoryl group
	onto an effector protein (a response regulator), thus modulating
	its activity. Histidine kinases and response regulators are usually
	found encoded as pairs of adjacent genes within a genome, with multiple
	examples in most prokaryotes. Recent studies have shed light on major
	themes of TCS evolution, including gene duplication, gene gain/loss,
	gene fusion/fission, domain gain/loss, domain shuffling and the emergence
	of complexity. Coupled with an understanding of the structural and
	biophysical properties of many TCS proteins, it has become increasingly
	possible to draw inferences regarding the functional consequences
	of such evolutionary changes. In turn, this increase in understanding
	has the potential to enhance both our ability to rationally engineer

	contemporary genetic diversity and empirical evidence to piece together
	the evolutionary history of C. jejuni and quantify its evolutionary
	potential. Our combined population genetics-phylogenetics approach
	reveals a surprising picture. Campylobacter jejuni is a rapidly evolving
	species, subject to intense purifying selection that purges 60\%
	of novel variation, but possessing a massive evolutionary potential.
	The low mutation rate is offset by a large effective population size
	so that a mutation at any site can occur somewhere in the population
	within the space of a week. Recombination has a fundamental role,
	generating diversity at twice the rate of de novo mutation, and facilitating
	gene flow between C. jejuni and its sister species Campylobacter
	coli. We attempt to calibrate the rate of molecular evolution in
	C. jejuni based solely on within-species variation. The rates we
	obtain are up to 1,000 times faster than conventional estimates,
	placing the C. jejuni-C. coli split at the time of the Neolithic

	life is presented; the name of the model derives from its resemblance
	to physical annealing. The scenario pictured starts when "genetic
	temperatures" were very high, cellular entities (progenotes) were
	very simple, and information processing systems were inaccurate.
	Initially, both mutation rate and lateral gene transfer levels were
	elevated. The latter was pandemic and pervasive to the extent that
	it, not vertical inheritance, defined the evolutionary dynamic. As
	increasingly complex and precise biological structures and processes
	evolved, both the mutation rate and the scope and level of lateral
	gene transfer, i.e., evolutionary temperature, dropped, and the evolutionary
	dynamic gradually became that characteristic of modern cells. The
	various subsystems of the cell "crystallized," i.e., became refractory
	to lateral gene transfer, at different stages of "cooling," with
	the translation apparatus probably crystallizing first. Organismal
	lineages, and so organisms as we know them, did not exist at these
	early stages. The universal phylogenetic tree, therefore, is not
	an organismal tree at its base but gradually becomes one as its peripheral
	branchings emerge. The universal ancestor is not a discrete entity.
	It is, rather, a diverse community of cells that survives and evolves
	as a biological unit. This communal ancestor has a physical history
	but not a genealogical one. Over time, this ancestor refined into
	a smaller number of increasingly complex cell types with the ancestors
	of the three primary groupings of organisms arising as a result.},

	the evolutionary profiles of the individual AARSs might be expected
	to be similar in general respects, they are not. It is argued that
	these differences in profiles reflect the stages in the evolutionary
	process when the taxonomic distributions of the individual AARSs

	transfer of archaeal AARSs to the Bacteria is more prevalent than
	the reverse, which is seen only for the "gemini group. " (iv) The

  abstract = {Phylogenetic analysis of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) of all
	20 specificities from completely sequenced bacterial, archaeal, and
	eukaryotic genomes reveals a complex evolutionary picture. Detailed
	examination of the domain architecture of aaRSs using sequence profile
	searches delineated a network of partially conserved domains that
	is even more elaborate than previously suspected. Several unexpected
	evolutionary connections were identified, including the apparent
	origin of the beta-subunit of bacterial GlyRS from the HD superfamily
	of hydrolases, a domain shared by bacterial AspRS and the B subunit
	of archaeal glutamyl-tRNA amidotransferases, and another previously
	undetected domain that is conserved in a subset of ThrRS, guanosine
	polyphosphate hydrolases and synthetases, and a family of GTPases.
	Comparison of domain architectures and multiple alignments resulted
	in the delineation of synapomorphies-shared derived characters, such
	as extra domains or inserts-for most of the aaRSs specificities.
	These synapomorphies partition sets of aaRSs with the same specificity
	into two or more distinct and apparently monophyletic groups. In
	conjunction with cluster analysis and a modification of the midpoint-rooting
	procedure, this partitioning was used to infer the likely root position
	in phylogenetic trees. The topologies of the resulting rooted trees
	for most of the aaRSs specificities are compatible with the evolutionary
	"standard model" whereby the earliest radiation event separated bacteria
	from the common ancestor of archaea and eukaryotes as opposed to
	the two other possible evolutionary scenarios for the three major
	divisions of life. For almost all aaRSs specificities, however, this
	simple scheme is confounded by displacement of some of the bacterial
	aaRSs by their eukaryotic or, less frequently, archaeal counterparts.
	Displacement of ancestral eukaryotic aaRS genes by bacterial ones,
	presumably of mitochondrial origin, was observed for three aaRSs.
	In contrast, there was no convincing evidence of displacement of
	archaeal aaRSs by bacterial ones. Displacement of aaRS genes by eukaryotic
	counterparts is most common among parasitic and symbiotic bacteria,
	particularly the spirochaetes, in which 10 of the 19 aaRSs seem to
	have been displaced by the respective eukaryotic genes and two by
	the archaeal counterpart. Unlike the primary radiation events between
	the three main divisions of life, that were readily traceable through
	the phylogenetic analysis of aaRSs, no consistent large-scale bacterial
	phylogeny could be established. In part, this may be due to additional
	gene displacement events among bacterial lineages. Argument is presented
	that, although lineage-specific gene loss might have contributed
	to the evolution of some of the aaRSs, this is not a viable alternative
	to horizontal gene transfer as the principal evolutionary phenomenon
	in this gene class.},

  abstract = {The question of whether or not all life on Earth shares a single common
	ancestor has been a central problem of evolutionary biology since
	Darwin. Although the theory of universal common ancestry (UCA) has
	gathered a compelling list of circumstantial evidence, as given in
	ref. 2, there has been no attempt to test statistically the UCA hypothesis
	among the three domains of life (eubacteria, archaebacteria and eukaryotes)
	by using molecular sequences. Theobald recently challenged this problem
	with a formal statistical test, and concluded that the UCA hypothesis
	holds. Although his attempt is the first step towards establishing
	the UCA theory with a solid statistical basis, we think that the
	test of Theobald is not sufficient enough to reject the alternative
	hypothesis of the separate origins of life, despite the Akaike information
	criterion (AIC) of model selection giving a clear distinction between
	the competing hypotheses.},

  title = {Dependence of paracentric inversion rate on tract length.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {115},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We develop a Bayesian method based on MCMC for estimating
	the relative rates of pericentric and paracentric inversions from
	marker data from two species. The method also allows estimation of
	the distribution of inversion tract lengths. RESULTS: We apply the
	method to data from Drosophila melanogaster and D. yakuba. We find
	that pericentric inversions occur at a much lower rate compared to
	paracentric inversions. The average paracentric inversion tract length
	is approx. 4.8 Mb with small inversions being more frequent than
	large inversions. If the two breakpoints defining a paracentric inversion
	tract are uniformly and independently distributed over chromosome
	arms there will be more short tract-length inversions than long;
	we find an even greater preponderance of short tract lengths than
	this would predict. Thus there appears to be a correlation between
	the positions of breakpoints which favors shorter tract lengths.
	CONCLUSION: The method developed in this paper provides the first
	statistical estimator for estimating the distribution of inversion
	tract lengths from marker data. Application of this method for a
	number of data sets may help elucidate the relationship between the
	length of an inversion and the chance that it will get accepted.},

	We have analyzed the evolution of mannose-class PTS transporters.
	These transporters have a limited distribution among bacteria being
	mostly harbored by species associated to animals. The results obtained
	indicate that these genes have undergone a complex evolutionary history,
	including extensive horizontal gene transfer events, duplications,
	and nonorthologous displacements. The phylogenetic analysis revealed
	an early diversification to specialize in different transport capabilities,
	but these events have also occurred relatively recently. In addition,
	these transporters can be further divided into seven groups and this
	division correlates with their transport capabilities. Finally, the
	consideration of the genomic context allowed us to propose putative
	functional roles for some uncharacterized PTS transporters. The functional
	role and distribution of mannose-class PTS transporters suggest that
	their expansion may have played a significant role in the establishment
	of symbiotic relationships between animals and some bacteria.},

	events within cyanobacteria, as well as between cyanobacteria and

	horizontal gene transfer events within a group of organisms based
	on analyses of "embedded quartets" allows us to identify phylogenetic
	signal consistent with a plurality of gene families, as well as to
	delineate cases of conflict to the plurality signal, which include
	horizontally transferred genes. To infer horizontal gene transfer
	events between cyanobacteria and other phyla, we added homologs from
	168 available genomes. We screened phylogenetic trees reconstructed
	for each of these extended gene families for highly supported monophyly
	of cyanobacteria (or lack of it). Cyanobacterial genomes reveal a
	complex evolutionary history, which cannot be represented by a single
	strictly bifurcating tree for all genes or even most genes, although
	a single completely resolved phylogeny was recovered from the quartets'
	plurality signals. We find more conflicts within cyanobacteria than
	between cyanobacteria and other phyla. We also find that genes from
	all functional categories are subject to transfer. However, in interphylum
	as compared to intraphylum transfers, the proportion of metabolic
	(operational) gene transfers increases, while the proportion of informational
	gene transfers decreases.},
