  abstract = {The sequence diversity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
	represents a major obstacle to the development of an effective vaccine,
	yet the forces impacting the evolution of this pathogen remain unclear.
	To address this issue we assessed the relationship between genome-wide
	viral evolution and adaptive CD8+ T-cell responses in four clade
	B virus-infected patients studied longitudinally for as long as 5
	years after acute infection. Of the 98 amino acid mutations identified
	in nonenvelope antigens, 53% were associated with detectable CD8+
	T-cell responses, indicative of positive selective immune pressures.
	An additional 18% of amino acid mutations represented substitutions
	toward common clade B consensus sequence residues, nine of which
	were strongly associated with HLA class I alleles not expressed by
	the subjects and thus indicative of reversions of transmitted CD8
	escape mutations. Thus, nearly two-thirds of all mutations were attributable
	to CD8+ T-cell selective pressures. A closer examination of CD8 escape
	mutations in additional persons with chronic disease indicated that
	not only did immune pressures frequently result in selection of identical
	amino acid substitutions in mutating epitopes, but mutating residues
	also correlated with highly polymorphic sites in both clade B and
	C viruses. These data indicate a dominant role for cellular immune
	selective pressures in driving both individual and global HIV-1 evolution.
	The stereotypic nature of acquired mutations provides support for
	biochemical constraints limiting HIV-1 evolution and for the impact
	of CD8 escape mutations on viral fitness.},

	might reasonably be hypothesized to be associated with better replicative
	capacity or to be more stable in the absence of host immune pressure

	1 (HIV-1) evolution is influenced by immune selection pressure, with
	population studies showing an association between specific HLA alleles
	and mutations within defined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes. Here
	we combine sequence data and functional studies of CD8 T-cell responses
	to demonstrate that allele-specific immune pressures also select
	for mutations flanking CD8 epitopes that impair antigen processing.
	In persons expressing HLA-A3, we demonstrate consistent selection
	for a mutation in a C-terminal flanking residue of the normally immunodominant
	Gag KK9 epitope that prevents its processing and presentation, resulting
	in a rapid decline in the CD8 T-cell response. This single amino
	acid substitution also lies within a second HLA-A3-restricted epitope,
	with the mutation directly impairing recognition by CD8 T cells.
	Transmission of the mutation to subjects expressing HLA-A3 was shown
	to prevent the induction of normally immunodominant acute-phase responses
	to both epitopes. However, subsequent in vivo reversion of the mutation
	was coincident with delayed induction of new CD8 T-cell responses
	to both epitopes. These data demonstrate that mutations within the
	flanking region of an HIV-1 epitope can impair recognition by an
	established CD8 T-cell response and that transmission of these mutations
	alters the acute-phase CD8(+) T-cell response. Moreover, reversion
	of these mutations in the absence of the original immune pressure
	reveals the potential plasticity of immunologically selected evolutionary
	changes.},

	examine the relative replicative capacities between these human lentiviruses.
	A pairwise competition experiment was performed with peripheral blood
	mononuclear cells with eight HIV-2 isolates, 6 group O viruses, and
	15 group M viruses of subtype A (2 viruses), B (5 viruses), C (4
	viruses), D (2 viruses) and CRF01_AE (2 viruses). HIV-1 group M isolates
	of any subtype were typically 100-fold-more fit than group O or HIV-2
	strains when competed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
	various humans. This order in replicative fitness was also observed
	when virus pairs were added to human dendritic cells and then cocultured
	with primary, quiescent T cells, which is the model for HIV-1 transmission.
	These results suggest that reduced replicative and transmission fitness

  journal = {Med Hypotheses},
  year = {2007},
  abstract = {Adaptive immune responses, cellular restrictive factors and antiretroviral
	drugs, target multiple regions in the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
	(HIV) proteome, imposing diverse pressures to viral adaptation. However,
	the virus is remarkably able to escape from these pressures as mutations
	are selected. In many cases these mutants have diminished viral fitness.
	We propose that the concerted action of strategically placed agents
	and pressures in a host can limit HIV variation capacity while inhibiting
	its replication. These mechanisms would corner HIV by selecting conflicting
	adaptive mutations, each having a disadvantage in face of another
	selective pressure. This would keep the virus unable to efficiently
	escape the suppressive effects of selective pressures. Cornering
	between antiretroviral drugs and cytotoxic T lymphocytes may explain
	recent observations, and can be predicted and used in viral control
	strategies. This idea can be extended to numerous other identified
	sites in the viral genome that confer selective pressures. We describe
	these other sites and how they could be induced to interact in prophylactic
	or therapeutic cornering strategies, as well as their experimental
	verifications. Cornering would control HIV infection better than
	current strategies, focused on few, albeit important, sites in the

	aminopeptidase in the endoplasmic reticulum that trims longer precursors
	to the antigenic peptides presented on MHC class I molecules. We
	recently reported that purified ERAP1 trimmed N-extended precursors
	but spared peptides of 8-9 residues, the length required for binding
	to MHC class I molecules. Here, we show another remarkable property
	of ERAP1: that it strongly prefers substrates 9-16 residues long,
	the lengths of peptides transported efficiently into the ER by the
	transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) transporter.
	This aminopeptidase rapidly degraded a model 13-mer to a 9-mer and
	then stopped, even though the substrate and the product had identical
	N- and C-terminal sequences. No other aminopeptidase, including the
	closely related ER-aminopeptidase ERAP2, showed a similar length
	preference. Unlike other aminopeptidases, the activity of ERAP1 depended
	on the C-terminal residue of the substrate. ERAP1, like most MHC
	class I molecules, prefers peptides with hydrophobic C termini and
	shows low affinity for peptides with charged C termini. Thus, ERAP1
	is specialized to process precursors transported by TAP to peptides
	that can serve as MHC class I epitopes. Its "molecular ruler" mechanism
	involves binding the hydrophobic C terminus of the substrate 9-16
	residues away from the active site.},

	was identified in the data available for several MHC class II alleles.
	Peptide length was incorporated into existing prediction algorithms
	using one of several modifications: using regression to pre-process
	the data, using peptide length as an additional variable within the
	algorithm, or representing register shifting in longer peptides.
	For several datasets and at least two algorithms these modifications

	immune response generated for chronic HIV-1 infection may not be
	adequate to protect against infection by a second HIV-1 strain. It
	has been unclear, though, whether these individuals are representative
	of the global epidemic or are rare cases. Here we show that in a
	population of high-risk women, HIV-1 reinfection occurs almost as
	commonly as first infections. The study was designed to detect cases
	of reinfection by HIV-1 of a different subtype and thus captured
	cases where there was considerable diversity between the first and
	second strain. In each case, the second virus emerged approximately
	1 year after the first infection, and in two cases, it emerged when
	viral levels were high, suggesting that a well-established HIV-1
	infection may provide little benefit in terms of immunizing against
	reinfection, at least by more-divergent HIV-1 variants. Our findings
	indicate an urgent need for studies of larger cohorts to determine
	the incidence and timing of both intersubtype and intrasubtype reinfection.},

	diversity and attendant capacity to escape immunologic recognition.
	Vaccine efficacy might be improved by maximizing immunogen antigenic
	similarity to viruses likely to be encountered by vaccinees. To this
	end, we designed a prototype HIV-1 envelope vaccine using a deduced
	ancestral state for the env gene. The ancestral state reconstruction
	method was shown to be >95% accurate by computer simulation and 99.8%
	accurate when estimating the known inoculum used in an experimental
	infection study in rhesus macaques. Furthermore, the deduced ancestor
	gene differed from the set of sequences used to derive the ancestor
	by an average of 12.3%, while these latter sequences were an average
	of 17.3% different from each other. A full-length ancestral subtype
	B HIV-1 env gene was constructed and shown to produce a glycoprotein
	of 160 kDa that bound and fused with cells expressing the HIV-1 coreceptor
	CCR5. This Env was also functional in a virus pseudotype assay. When
	either gp160- or gp140-expressing plasmids and recombinant gp120
	were used to immunize rabbits in a DNA prime-protein boost regimen,
	the artificial gene induced immunoglobulin G antibodies capable of
	weakly neutralizing heterologous primary HIV-1 strains. The results
	were similar for rabbits immunized in parallel with a natural isolate,
	HIV-1 SF162. Further design efforts to better present conserved neutralization
	determinants are warranted.},

  abstract = {In the absence of antiretroviral treatment, HIV-1 establishes a chronic,
	progressive infection of the human immune system that invariably,
	over the course of years, leads to its destruction and fatal immunodeficiency.
	Paradoxically, while viral replication is extensive throughout the
	course of infection, deterioration of conventional measures of immunity
	is slow, including the characteristic loss of CD4(+) T cells that
	is thought to play a key role in the development of immunodeficiency.
	This conundrum suggests that CD4(+) T cell-directed viral cytopathicity
	alone cannot explain the course of disease. Indeed, recent advances
	now indicate that HIV-1 pathogenesis is likely to result from a complex
	interplay between the virus and the immune system, particularly the
	mechanisms responsible for T cell homeostasis and regeneration. We
	review these data and present a model of HIV-1 pathogenesis in which
	the protracted loss of CD4(+) T cells results from early viral destruction
	of selected memory T cell populations, followed by a combination
	of profound increases in overall memory T cell turnover, damage to
	the thymus and other lymphoid tissues, and physiological limitations

  abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular
	clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance
	in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically
	unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these
	two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed
	molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate
	to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new
	approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe
	how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in
	the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times.
	Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness
	of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and
	phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches
	in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are
	not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these
	datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular
	clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses
	of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate
	alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically
	more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while

  abstract = {The evolution of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) during chronic
	infection involves the rapid, continuous turnover of genetic diversity.
	However, the role of natural selection, relative to random genetic
	drift, in governing this process is unclear. We tested a stochastic
	model of genetic drift using partial envelope sequences sampled longitudinally
	in 28 infected children. In each case the Bayesian posterior (empirical)
	distribution of coalescent genealogies was estimated using Markov
	chain Monte Carlo methods. Posterior predictive simulation was then
	used to generate a null distribution of genealogies assuming neutrality,
	with the null and empirical distributions compared using four genealogy-based
	summary statistics sensitive to nonneutral evolution. Because both
	null and empirical distributions were generated within a coalescent
	framework, we were able to explicitly account for the confounding
	influence of demography. From the distribution of corrected P-values
	across patients, we conclude that empirical genealogies are more
	asymmetric than expected if evolution is driven by mutation and genetic
	drift only, with an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms in the
	population. This indicates that although drift may still play an
	important role, natural selection has a strong influence on the evolution
	of HIV-1 envelope. A negative relationship between effective population
	size and substitution rate indicates that as the efficacy of selection
	increases, a smaller proportion of mutations approach fixation in
	the population. This suggests the presence of deleterious mutations.
	We therefore conclude that intrahost HIV-1 evolution in envelope
	is dominated by purifying selection against low-frequency deleterious
	mutations that do not reach fixation.},

  abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is established
	by virus variants that use the CCR5 co-receptor for entry (CCR5-tropic
	or R5 variants), whereas viruses that use CXCR4 as co-receptor (CXCR4-tropic
	or X4 variants) emerge during disease progression in approximately
	50 % of infected subjects. X4 variants may have a higher fitness
	ex vivo and their detection is usually accompanied by faster T-cell
	depletion and the onset of AIDS in HIV-1-positive individuals. Here,
	the relationship between the sequence variation of the HIV-1 env
	V3-V5 region and positive selective pressure on R5 and X4 variants
	from infected subjects with CD4 T cell counts below 200 cells microl(-1)
	was studied. A correlation was found between genetic distance and
	CD4(+) cell count at late stages of the disease. R5 variants that
	co-existed with X4 variants were significantly less heterogeneous
	than R5 variants from subjects without X4 variants (P < 0.0001).
	Similarly, X4 variants had a significantly higher diversity than
	R5 variants (P < 0.0001), although residues under positive selection
	had a similar distribution pattern in both variants. Therefore, both
	X4 and R5 variants were subjected to high selective pressures from
	the host. Furthermore, the interaction between X4 and R5 variants
	within the same subject resulted in a purifying selection on R5 variants,
	which only survived as a homogeneous virus population. These results
	indicate that R5 variants from X4 phenotype samples were highly homogeneous
	and under weakly positive selective pressures. In contrast, R5 variants
	from R5 phenotype samples were highly heterogeneous and subject to
	positive selective pressures.},

	with clade B, although common in one infected with clade C. HLA-B*1503
	was associated with reduced viral loads in the clade B cohort but

	Clade B viral control was associated with responses to several subdominant

	an important goal of HIV vaccines. However, CTLs select for viral
	variants that escape immune detection. Maintenance of such escape
	variants in human populations could pose an obstacle to HIV vaccine
	development. We first observed that escape mutations in a heterogeneous
	simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolate were lost upon passage
	to new animals. We therefore infected macaques with a cloned SIV
	bearing escape mutations in three immunodominant CTL epitopes, and
	followed viral evolution after infection. Here we show that each
	mutant epitope sequence continued to evolve in vivo, often re-establishing
	the original, CTL-susceptible sequence. We conclude that escape from
	CTL responses may exact a cost to viral fitness. In the absence of
	selective pressure upon transmission to new hosts, these original
	escape mutations can be lost. This suggests that some HIV CTL epitopes
	will be maintained in human populations.},

  abstract = {HIV type 1 (HIV-1) can rapidly escape from neutralizing antibody responses.
	The genetic basis of this escape in vivo is poorly understood. We
	compared the pattern of evolution of the HIV-1 env gene between individuals
	with recent HIV infection whose virus exhibited either a low or a
	high rate of escape from neutralizing antibody responses. We demonstrate
	that the rate of viral escape at a phenotypic level is highly variable
	among individuals, and is strongly correlated with the rate of amino
	acid substitutions. We show that dramatic escape from neutralizing
	antibodies can occur in the relative absence of changes in glycosylation
	or insertions and deletions (indels) in the envelope; conversely,
	changes in glycosylation and indels occur even in the absence of
	neutralizing antibody responses. Comparison of our data with the
	predictions of a mathematical model support a mechanism in which
	escape from neutralizing antibodies occurs via many amino acid substitutions,
	with low cross-neutralization between closely related viral strains.
	Our results suggest that autologous neutralizing antibody responses
	may play a pivotal role in the diversification of HIV-1 envelope
	during the early stages of infection.},

	at estimating the costs of CTL escape mutations in terms of the reduction
	in viral fitness and the killing rate at which the CTL response specific
	to one viral epitope clears virus-infected cells. Using a mathematical
	model we show that estimation of both parameters depends critically
	on the underlying changes in the replication rate of the virus and
	the changes in the killing rate over time (which in previous studies
	were assumed to be constant). We provide a theoretical basis for
	estimation of these parameters using in vivo data. In particular,
	we show that 1) by assuming unlimited virus growth one can obtain
	a minimal estimate of the fitness cost of the escape mutation, and
	2) by assuming no virus growth during the escape, one can obtain
	a minimal estimate of the average killing rate. We also discuss the
	conditions under which better estimates of the average killing rate
	can be obtained.},

	DNA sequences is revealed by an excess of nonsynonymous substitutions

	Methods for analyzing the patterns of nonsynonymous and synonymous
	substitutions usually rely on stochastic models in which the selection
	regime may vary across the sequence but remains constant across lineages
	for any amino acid position. Despite some work that has relaxed the
	constraint that selection patterns remain constant over time, no
	model provides a strong statistical framework to deal with switches
	between selection processes at individual sites during the course
	of evolution. This paper describes an approach that allows the site-specific
	selection process to vary along lineages of a phylogenetic tree.
	The parameters of the switching model of codon substitution are estimated
	by using maximum likelihood. The analysis of eight HIV-1 env homologous
	sequence data sets shows that this model provides a significantly
	better fit to the data than one that does not take into account switches
	between selection patterns in the phylogeny at individual sites.
	We also provide strong evidence that the strength and the frequency
	of occurrence of selection might not be estimated accurately when
	the site-specific variation of selection regimes is ignored.},

	between donors and recipients in known transmission pairs, and (iii)
	within individual hosts over time in relation to the initially replicating
	virus and to the deduced ancestral sequence of the intrahost viral
	population. Surprisingly, we consistently found less divergence between
	viruses from different individuals sampled in primary infection than
	in individuals sampled at more advanced stages of illness. Furthermore,
	longitudinal analysis of intrahost divergence revealed a 2- to 3-year
	period of evolution toward a common ancestral sequence at the start
	of infection, indicating that HIV recovers certain ancestral features

  abstract = {Bioinformatics approaches are increasingly being used to identify
	and understand the genetic variation underlying changes in HIV-1
	biological phenotype. The variable regions of the viral envelope
	are the major determinant of virus coreceptor usage and cell tropism.
	Specifically, amino acids 11 and 25 in the 3rd variable (V3) loop
	have been found to strongly influence viral syncytium inducing capacity
	and coreceptor usage. Many additional V3 loop changes, however, as
	well as changes elsewhere in Env, are thought to contribute to phenotype.
	In this review we describe several recently developed methods to
	analyze this variability and their use to predict biological phenotype
	based on sequence information. These approaches have identified changes
	in the V3 loop, in addition to the known changes at positions 11
	and 25, that affect phenotype and significantly enhance our ability
	to predict phenotype from genotype. Besides improving phenotype prediction,
	methods that score V3 sequences on a continuous scale can also assist
	in the interpretation of evolutionary information about shifts in
	phenotype, and the relationship between that evolution and pathogenesis.
	Several examples and potential practical applications of this scoring
	are discussed. We conclude that advances in computational approaches
	have enhanced both our ability to predict and to understand HIV-1
	biological phenotype evolution. Further development of these methods,
	by extending analysis to regions outside the V3 loop and to clades
	beyond subtype B, will extend our understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis
	and inform treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {In the Bayesian paradigm, a common method for comparing two models
	is to compute the Bayes factor, defined as the ratio of their respective
	marginal likelihoods. In recent phylogenetic works, the numerical
	evaluation of marginal likelihoods has often been performed using
	the harmonic mean estimation procedure. In the present article, we
	propose to employ another method, based on an analogy with statistical
	physics, called thermodynamic integration. We describe the method,
	propose an implementation, and show on two analytical examples that
	this numerical method yields reliable estimates. In contrast, the
	harmonic mean estimator leads to a strong overestimation of the marginal
	likelihood, which is all the more pronounced as the model is higher
	dimensional. As a result, the harmonic mean estimator systematically
	favors more parameter-rich models, an artefact that might explain
	some recent puzzling observations, based on harmonic mean estimates,
	suggesting that Bayes factors tend to overscore complex models. Finally,
	we apply our method to the comparison of several alternative models
	of amino-acid replacement. We confirm our previous observations,
	indicating that modeling pattern heterogeneity across sites tends
	to yield better models than standard empirical matrices.},

	in the rate of disease progression is poorly understood and has been
	attributed to host genetics, host immune responses, co-infection,

	phylogenetic method to estimate absolute rates of synonymous and

	association between the synonymous substitution rate of HIV and disease
	progression parameters. Since immune activation is the major determinant

	determine viral generation times, by creating favourable conditions
	for HIV replication. These conclusions may apply more generally to
	HIV evolution, since we also observed an overall low synonymous substitution
	rate for HIV-2, which is known to be less pathogenic than HIV-1 and
	capable of tempering the detrimental effects of immune activation.
	Humoral immune responses, on the other hand, are the major determinant
	of nonsynonymous rate changes through time in the envelope gene,
	and our relaxed-clock estimates support a decrease in selective pressure

	(HIV-1) enables it to continuously evade host CD8+ T-cell responses.
	The observed transmission, and potential accumulation, of CD8+ T-cell
	escape mutations in the population may suggest a gradual adaptation
	of HIV-1 to immune pressures. Recent reports, however, have highlighted
	the propensity of some escape mutations to revert upon transmission
	to a new host in order to restore efficient replication capacity.
	To more specifically address the role of reversions in early HIV-1
	evolution, we examined sequence polymorphisms arising across the
	HIV-1 genome in seven subjects followed longitudinally 1 year from
	primary infection. As expected, numerous nonsynonymous mutations
	were associated with described CD8+ T-cell epitopes, supporting a
	prominent role for cellular immune responses in driving early HIV-1
	evolution. Strikingly, however, a substantial proportion of substitutions
	(42%) reverted toward the clade B consensus sequence, with nearly
	one-quarter of them located within defined CD8 epitopes not restricted
	by the contemporary host's HLA. More importantly, these reversions
	arose significantly faster than forward mutations, with the most
	rapidly reverting mutations preferentially arising within structurally
	conserved residues. These data suggest that many transmitted mutations
	likely incur a fitness cost that is recovered through retrieval of
	an optimal, or ancestral, form of the virus. The propensity of mutations
	to revert may limit the accumulation of immune pressure-driven mutations
	in the population, thus preserving critical CD8+ T-cell epitopes
	as vaccine targets, and argue against an unremitting adaptation of
	HIV-1 to host immune pressures.},

	a nearly homogeneous viral population first emerges and then diversifies

	identify these forces, we conducted an intensive longitudinal study
	of viral genetic changes and T-cell immunity in one subject at <
	or =17 time points during his first 3 years of infection, and in
	his infecting partner near the time of transmission. Autologous peptides
	covering amino acid sites inferred to be under positive selection
	were powerful for identifying HIV-1-specific cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte
	(CTL) epitopes. Positive selection and mutations resulting in escape
	from CTLs occurred across the viral proteome. We detected 25 CTL
	epitopes, including 14 previously unreported. Seven new epitopes
	mapped to the viral Env protein, emphasizing Env as a major target
	of CTLs. One-third of the selected sites were associated with epitopic
	mutational escapes from CTLs. Most of these resulted from replacement
	with amino acids found at low database frequency. Another one-third
	represented acquisition of amino acids found at high database frequency,
	suggesting potential reversions of CTL epitopic sites recognized
	by the immune system of the transmitting partner and mutation toward
	improved viral fitness in the absence of immune targeting within
	the recipient. A majority of the remaining selected sites occurred
	in the envelope protein and may have been subjected to humoral immune
	selection. Hence, a majority of the amino acids undergoing selection
	in this subject appeared to result from fitness-balanced CTL selection,

  abstract = {The external subunit of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)
	envelope glycoprotein (Env), gp120, contains conserved regions that
	mediate sequential interactions with two cellular receptor molecules,
	CD4 and a chemokine receptor, most commonly CCR5 or CXCR4. However,
	antibody accessibility to such regions is hindered by diverse protective
	mechanisms, including shielding by variable loops, conformational
	flexibility and extensive glycosylation. For the conserved neutralization
	epitopes hitherto described, antibody accessibility is reportedly
	unrelated to the viral coreceptor usage phenotype. Here, we characterize
	a novel, conserved gp120 neutralization epitope, recognized by a
	murine monoclonal antibody (MAb), D19, which is differentially accessible
	in the native HIV-1 Env according to its coreceptor specificity.
	The D19 epitope is contained within the third variable (V3) domain
	of gp120 and is distinct from those recognized by other V3-specific
	MAbs. To study the reactivity of MAb D19 with the native oligomeric
	Env, we generated a panel of PM1 cells persistently infected with
	diverse primary HIV-1 strains. The D19 epitope was conserved in the
	majority (23/29; 79.3%) of the subtype-B strains tested, as well
	as in selected strains from other genetic subtypes. Strikingly, in
	CCR5-restricted (R5) isolates, the D19 epitope was invariably cryptic,
	although it could be exposed by addition of soluble CD4 (sCD4); epitope
	masking was dependent on the native oligomeric structure of Env,
	since it was not observed with the corresponding monomeric gp120
	molecules. By contrast, in CXCR4-using strains (X4 and R5X4), the
	epitope was constitutively accessible. In accordance with these results,
	R5 isolates were resistant to neutralization by MAb D19, becoming
	sensitive only upon addition of sCD4, whereas CXCR4-using isolates
	were neutralized regardless of the presence of sCD4. Other V3 epitopes
	examined did not display a similar divergence in accessibility based
	on coreceptor usage phenotype. These results provide the first evidence
	of a correlation between HIV-1 biological phenotype and neutralization
	sensitivity, raising the possibility that the in vivo evolution of
	HIV-1 coreceptor usage may be influenced by the selective pressure
	of specific host antibodies.},

	are subject to both lineage-specific and locus-specific effects.
	Additionally, the new tests suggest tha the rate heterogeneity is

	consisting of a combination of sparse encoding, Blosum encoding,
	and input derived from hidden Markov models. We demonstrate that
	the combination of several neural networks derived using different
	sequence-encoding schemes has a performance superior to neural networks
	derived using a single sequence-encoding scheme. The new method is
	shown to have a performance that is substantially higher than that
	of other methods. By use of mutual information calculations we show
	that peptides that bind to the HLA A*0204 complex display signal
	of higher order sequence correlations. Neural networks are ideally
	suited to integrate such higher order correlations when predicting
	the binding affinity. It is this feature combined with the use of
	several neural networks derived from different and novel sequence-encoding
	schemes and the ability of the neural network to be trained on data
	consisting of continuous binding affinities that gives the new method
	an improved performance. The difference in predictive performance
	between the neural network methods and that of the matrix-driven
	methods is found to be most significant for peptides that bind strongly
	to the HLA molecule, confirming that the signal of higher order sequence
	correlation is most strongly present in high-binding peptides. Finally,
	we use the method to predict T-cell epitopes for the genome of hepatitis

	and tested for their ability to bind and form stable complexes with
	the HLA-A2 molecule. The most efficient binders are also tested for
	inhibition of the T cell receptor recognition of two known CD8(+)
	T effectors. Results show that all 10 peptides bind the expected
	MHC protein. The six strongest binders also form stable HLA-A2-peptide

	first two weeks of treatment owing to the rapid elimination of free
	virus with a half-life (t1/2) of < or =6 hours and loss of productively

	the loss of long-lived infected cells (t1/2 of 1-4 weeks) is a major
	contributor to the second phase, whereas the activation of latently
	infected lymphocytes (t1/2 of 0.5-2 weeks) is only a minor source.
	Based on these decay characteristics, we estimate that 2.3-3.1 years

	The coreceptor usage of an HIV strain (CCR5 vs. CXCR4) largely defines
	its cytopathology, replication kinetics, and tissue tropism in in
	vitro culture. CXCR4-using (X4) isolates tend to replicate rapidly,
	induce the formation of syncitia (giant multinucleated cells), and
	have the capacity to infect transformed T cell lines. CCR5-using
	(R5) isolates, on the other hand, replicate slowly, do not induce
	syncytia, and can often infect monocyte-derived macrophages in a
	laboratory setting (Fenyo et al, 1997).
	
	Coreceptor usage is also indicative of in vivo pathogenicity and transmissibility.
	CXCR4 strains are associated with more rapid progression to AIDS,
	in line with their accelerated replication rates in vitro (Kreisberg
	et al, 2001). It has been observed that HIV-infected individuals
	experiencing opportunistic infections associated with end-stage disease
	are several times more likely to harbor a syncitium-inducing (X4)
	strain than asymptomatic patients (Richman et al, 1994). In addition,
	people homozygous for a common 32 base-pair deletion in the gene
	encoding the CCR5 receptor may only be productively infected by CXCR4-using
	HIV variants (Michael et al, 1998). Coreceptor usage also modulates
	viral access to various compartments within the human body, due to
	tissue-specific cellular characteristics. For example, HIV infection
	in the central nervous system is highly correlated with the preferential
	usage of CCR5, while the thymus is mainly colonized by X4 variants
	(Shieh et al, 1998;Kitchen et al, 1997). In light of the AIDS epidemic
	as a whole, the majority of HIV-positive individuals are initially
	infected with R5 HIV strains, suggesting that there may be a selective
	advantage of such variants with respect to transmission (van't Wout
	et al, 1994).
	
	In all, the coreceptor used by a particular HIV strain is highly indicative
	of its behavior both in in vitro and in vivo settings. Unsurprisingly,
	the determination of this viral phenotype is critical in a wide variety
	of HIV research contexts. Coreceptor usage is typically determined
	by either laboratory-based assay or amino acid sequence-based prediction.

	they are often implausible when literally translated. This is especially

	independent change among codons are considered. With this comparatively
	realistic framework, an evolutionary rate at a site can depend both
	on the state of the site and on the states of surrounding sites.
	By allowing a relatively general dependence structure among sites,
	models of evolution can reflect attributes of tertiary structure.
	To quantify the impact of protein structure on protein evolution,
	we analyze protein-coding DNA sequence pairs with an evolutionary
	model that incorporates effects of solvent accessibility and pairwise
	interactions among amino acid residues. By explicitly considering
	the relationship between nonsynonymous substitution rates and protein
	structure, this approach can lead to refined detection and characterization
	of positive selection. Analyses of simulated sequence pairs indicate
	that parameters in this evolutionary model can be well estimated.
	Analyses of lysozyme c and annexin V sequence pairs yield the biologically
	reasonable result that amino acid replacement rates are higher when
	the replacements lead to energetically favorable proteins than when
	they destabilize the proteins. Although the focus here is evolutionary
	dependence among codons that is associated with protein structure,

  abstract = {In recent works, methods have been proposed for applying phylogenetic
	models that allow for a general interdependence between the amino
	acid positions of a protein. As of yet, such models have focused
	on site interdependencies resulting from sequence-structure compatibility
	constraints, using simplified structural representations in combination
	with a set of statistical potentials. This structural compatibility
	criterion is meant as a proxy for sequence fitness, and the methods
	developed thus far can incorporate different site-interdependent
	fitness proxies based on other measurements. However, no methods
	have been proposed for comparing and evaluating the adequacy of alternative
	fitness proxies in this context, or for more general comparisons
	with canonical models of protein evolution. In the present work,
	we apply Bayesian methods of model selection-based on numerical calculations
	of marginal likelihoods and posterior predictive checks-to evaluate
	models encompassing the site-interdependent framework. Our application
	of these methods indicates that considering site-interdependencies,
	as done here, leads to an improved model fit for all data sets studied.
	Yet, we find that the use of pairwise contact potentials alone does
	not suitably account for across-site rate heterogeneity or amino
	acid exchange propensities; for such complexities, site-independent
	treatments are still called for. The most favored models combine
	the use of statistical potentials with a suitably rich site-independent
	model. Altogether, the methodology employed here should allow for
	a more rigorous and systematic exploration of different ways of modeling
	explicit structural constraints, or any other site-interdependent
	criterion, while best exploiting the richness of previously proposed
	models.},

  abstract = {Comparative genomic studies have been useful in identifying transcriptional
	regulatory elements in higher eukaryotic genomes, but many important
	regulatory elements cannot be detected by such analyses due to evolutionary
	variations and alignment tool limitations. Therefore, in this study
	we exploit the highly conserved nature of epigenetic modifications
	to identify potential transcriptional enhancers. By using a high-resolution
	genome-wide mapping technique, which combines the chromatin immunoprecipitation
	and serial analysis of gene expression assays, we have recently determined
	the distribution of lysine 9/14-diacetylated histone H3 in human
	T cells. We showed the existence of 46,813 regions with clusters
	of histone acetylation, termed histone acetylation islands, some
	of which correspond to known transcriptional regulatory elements.
	In the present study, we find that 4679 sequences conserved between
	human and pufferfish coincide with histone acetylation islands, and
	random sampling shows that 33% (13/39) of these can function as transcriptional
	enhancers in human Jurkat T cells. In addition, by comparing the
	human histone acetylation island sequences with mouse genome sequences,
	we find that despite the conservation of many of these regions between
	these species, 21,855 of these sequences are not conserved. Furthermore,
	we demonstrate that about 50% (26/51) of these nonconserved sequences
	have enhancer activity in Jurkat cells, and that many of the orthologous
	mouse sequences also have enhancer activity in addition to conserved
	epigenetic modification patterns in mouse T-cell chromatin. Therefore,
	by combining epigenetic modification and sequence data, we have established
	a novel genome-wide method for identifying regulatory elements not
	discernable by comparative genomics alone.},

	using similarity scores.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {501},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modelling the interaction between potentially antigenic
	peptides and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules is
	a key step in identifying potential T-cell epitopes. For Class II
	MHC alleles, the binding groove is open at both ends, causing ambiguity
	in the positional alignment between the groove and peptide, as well
	as creating uncertainty as to what parts of the peptide interact
	with the MHC. Moreover, the antigenic peptides have variable lengths,
	making naive modelling methods difficult to apply. This paper introduces
	a kernel method that can handle variable length peptides effectively
	by quantifying similarities between peptide sequences and integrating
	these into the kernel. RESULTS: The kernel approach presented here
	shows increased prediction accuracy with a significantly higher number
	of true positives and negatives on multiple MHC class II alleles,
	when testing data sets from MHCPEP 1, MCHBN 2, and MHCBench 3. Evaluation
	by cross validation, when segregating binders and non-binders, produced
	an average of 0.824 AROC for the MHCBench data sets (up from 0.756),
	and an average of 0.96 AROC for multiple alleles of the MHCPEP database.
	CONCLUSION: The method improves performance over existing state-of-the-art
	methods of MHC class II peptide binding predictions by using a custom,
	knowledge-based representation of peptides. Similarity scores, in
	contrast to a fixed-length, pocket-specific representation of amino
	acids, provide a flexible and powerful way of modelling MHC binding,
	and can easily be applied to other dynamic sequence problems.},

	primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and
	the development of AIDS, we studied the evolution of the C2-V5 region
	of the HIV-1 env gene and of T-cell subsets in nine men with a moderate
	or slow rate of disease progression. They were monitored from the
	time of seroconversion for a period of 6 to 12 years until the development
	of advanced disease in seven men. Based on the analysis of viral
	divergence from the founder strain, viral population diversity within
	sequential time points, and the outgrowth of viruses capable of utilizing
	the CXCR4 receptor (X4 viruses), the existence of three distinct
	phases within the asymptomatic interval is suggested: an early phase
	of variable duration during which linear increases ( approximately
	1% per year) in both divergence and diversity were observed; an intermediate
	phase lasting an average of 1.8 years, characterized by a continued
	increase in divergence but with stabilization or decline in diversity;
	and a late phase characterized by a slowdown or stabilization of
	divergence and continued stability or decline in diversity. X4 variants
	emerged around the time of the early- to intermediate-phase transition
	and then achieved peak representation and began a decline around
	the transition between the intermediate and late phases. The late-phase
	transition was also associated with failure of T-cell homeostasis
	(defined by a downward inflection in CD3(+) T cells) and decline
	of CD4(+) T cells to </=200 cells/microliter. The strength of these
	temporal associations between viral divergence and diversity, viral
	coreceptor specificity, and T-cell homeostasis and subset composition
	supports the concept that the phases described represent a consistent
	pattern of viral evolution during the course of HIV-1 infection in
	moderate progressors. Recognition of this pattern may help explain
	previous conflicting data on the relationship between viral evolution
	and disease progression and may provide a useful framework for evaluating

	fragments of most, if not all, intracellular proteins. The antigen
	processing machinery accomplishes the daunting task of sampling these
	proteins and cleaving them into the precise set of peptides displayed
	by MHC I molecules. It has long been believed that antigenic peptides
	arose as by-products of normal protein turnover. Recent evidence,
	however, suggests that the primary source of peptides is newly synthesized
	proteins that arise from conventional as well as cryptic translational
	reading frames. It is increasingly clear that for many peptides the
	C-terminus is generated in the cytoplasm, and N-terminal trimming
	occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum in an MHC I-dependent manner.
	Nature's gene-chips are thus both parsimonious and elegant.},

  annote = {A review of antigen processing and this is a nice conclusion of antigen
	process:
	
	In conclusion, based upon the evidence discussed above, we suggest
	a model for the MHC I antigen processing pathway. Newly synthesized
	polypeptides including cryptic translation products serve as the
	primary source of antigenic peptides. The precursors are cleaved
	by the proteasome and other proteases to generate a mixture of proteolytic
	intermediates that have the correct C-terminal end of the antigenic
	peptide. The intermediates, perhaps assisted by cytoplasmic chaperones,
	are transported by TAP into the ER. After transport into the ER,
	the extra N-terminal residues are processively removed by an aminopeptidase,
	likely using the MHC as a template, until the product fits the antigen-binding
	groove of the MHC I molecule with high affinity. This final peptide/MHC
	I complex exits the ER and serves as a potential ligand for CD8+
	T cells on the APC surface.
	
	Several features of this model make it attractive for explaining the
	efficiency of the antigen processing pathway. First, using newly
	synthesized precursors rather than protein turnover as the primary
	source of antigenic peptides allows the antigen processing mechanism
	to tap into the total range of polypeptides synthesized in the cells,
	regardless of when and where the mature proteins are degraded. This
	mechanism would also accelerate the recognition of abnormal cells.
	Second, the stepwise proteolysis of precursors has important implications
	for the efficiency of peptide generation. Cytoplasmic processing
	in this view yields a rough-draft of the final peptide with the correct
	C-terminus. Cytoplasmic processing and transport, by making the C-termini,
	essentially define which peptides can be presented. Nonetheless,
	the proteolytic mechanisms do not bear the burden of generating the
	exact peptides that the MHC I molecules need in the ER. ER trimming
	of N-terminal flanking residues, under the guidance of MHC I molecules,
	enables the mechanism to be flexible, and at the same time, maximizes
	precision.},

	that, as an adaptation on the part of the host to constrain parasite
	escape from immune control, class I major histocompatibility complex
	(MHC) molecules present peptides that are derived from conserved
	regions of foreign proteins to CTLs. We did this by estimating the
	relative conservation of CTL epitopes of the functionally important

	this to the structure and function of the protein. In comparisons
	among sequences from several HIV-1 subtypes and both major groups,
	CTL epitopes had lower rates of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution
	per site than did the remainder of the protein, indicating the relative
	conservation of these epitopes. In contrast, helper T-cell epitopes
	were as conserved as, and monoclonal antibody epitopes less conserved
	than, the remainder of the protein. The conservation of CTL epitopes
	is apparently due to their derivation from functionally important
	domains of Nef, since CTL epitopes coincide with these domains and
	these domains are conserved relative to the remainder of the protein,
	in contrast to secondary structural elements, which are not. Recent
	studies provide evidence of CTL selection on HIV-1 epitopes, but
	the variational range of viral escape mutants appears to be limited
	by functional constraints on the protein regions from which epitopes
	are derived. The presentation of conserved foreign peptides to CTLs
	by class I MHC molecules may be a general adaptation of vertebrate
	hosts to constrain the adaptation of their intracellular parasites.},

	a high diversity of HIV-1 genetic forms in Cuba, including two potential
	novel circulating recombinant forms (CRF): U/H and D/A. OBJECTIVES:
	To determine whether U/H recombinant viruses from Cuba, detected
	in 7% of samples, represent a novel HIV-1 CRF, and to identify non-Cuban
	viruses related to this recombinant form. METHODS: Near full-length
	genome amplification was carried out by nested polymerase chain reaction
	in four overlapping DNA segments of two epidemiologically unlinked
	viruses in uncultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The sequences
	were analysed phylogenetically. Recombinant structures and phylogenetic
	relationships were analysed by bootscanning and by maximum likelihood.
	Searches for related viruses in databases were initially based on
	sequence homology and sharing of signature nucleotides. RESULTS:
	Both Cuban viruses clustered uniformly in bootscans all along the
	genome with each other and with a virus from Cameroon, CM53379, indicating
	that all three represent the same recombinant form. Their genome
	comprised multiple segments clustering with subtypes A1, F, G, H
	and K, as well as segments failing to cluster with recognized subtypes.
	The newly defined CRF, designated CRF18_cpx, was phylogenetically
	related in partial segments to CRF13_cpx, CRF04_cpx and 36 additional
	viruses, most of them from Central Africa. One of the viruses from
	Cameroon, sequenced in the near full-length genome, was a CRF18_cpx/subtype

	gp120 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and the chemokine
	receptors that are used as the second receptor for HIV, we evaluated
	amino acid site variation of gp120 between the X4 strains (use CXCR4)
	and the R5 strains (use CCR5) from 21 sequences of subtype B. Our
	analysis showed that residues 306 and 322 in the V3 loop and residue
	440 in the C4 region were associated with usage of the second receptor.
	The polymorphism at residue 440 is clearly associated with the usage
	of the second receptor: The amino acid at position 440 was a basic
	amino acid in the R5 strains, and a nonbasic and smaller amino acid
	in the X4 strains, while the V3 loop of the X4 strains was more basic
	than that of the R5 strains. This suggests that residue 440 in the
	C4 region, which is close to the V3 loop in the three-dimensional
	structure, is critical in determining which second receptor is used.
	Analysis of codon frequency suggests that, in almost all cases, the
	difference at residue 440 between basic amino acids in the R5 strains
	and nonbasic amino acids in the X4 strains could be due to a single
	nucleotide change. These findings predict that the evolutionary changes
	in amino acid residue 440 may be correlated with evolutionary changes
	in the V3 loop. One possibility is that a change in electric charge
	at residue 440 compensates for a change in electric charge in the
	V3 loop. The amino acid polymorphism at position 440 can be useful
	to predict the cell tropism of a strain of HIV-1 subtype B.},

	Although most antigenic proteins contain many sequences that could
	bind to MHC class I, few of these peptides actually stimulate CD8(+)
	T cell responses. Moreover, the T cell responses that are generated
	often follow a very reproducible hierarchy to different peptides
	for reasons that are poorly understood. We find that the loss of
	a single enzyme, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1),
	in the antigen-processing pathway results in a marked shift in the
	hierarchy of immunodominance in viral infections, even when the responding
	T cells have the same T cell receptor repertoire. In mice, ERAP1
	is the major enzyme that trims precursor peptides in the endoplasmic
	reticulum and, in this process, can generate or destroy antigenic
	peptides. Consequently, when ERAP1 is lost, the immune response to
	some viral peptides is reduced, to others increased, and to yet others
	unchanged. Therefore, many epitopes must be initially generated as
	precursors that are normally trimmed by ERAP1 before binding to MHC
	class I, whereas others are normally degraded by ERAP1 to lengths
	that are too short to bind to MHC class I. Moreover, peptide trimming
	and the resulting abundance of peptide-MHC complexes are dominant
	factors in establishing immunodominance.},

  abstract = {Although probabilistic models of genotype (e.g., DNA sequence) evolution
	have been greatly elaborated, less attention has been paid to the
	effect of phenotype on the evolution of the genotype. Here we propose
	an evolutionary model and a Bayesian inference procedure that are
	aimed at filling this gap. In the model, RNA secondary structure
	links genotype and phenotype by treating the approximate free energy
	of a sequence folded into a secondary structure as a surrogate for
	fitness. The underlying idea is that a nucleotide substitution resulting
	in a more stable secondary structure should have a higher rate than
	a substitution that yields a less stable secondary structure. This
	free energy approach incorporates evolutionary dependencies among
	sequence positions beyond those that are reflected simply by jointly
	modeling change at paired positions in an RNA helix. Although there
	is not a formal requirement with this approach that secondary structure
	be known and nearly invariant over evolutionary time, computational
	considerations make these assumptions attractive and they have been
	adopted in a software program that permits statistical analysis of
	multiple homologous sequences that are related via a known phylogenetic
	tree topology. Analyses of 5S ribosomal RNA sequences are presented
	to illustrate and quantify the strong impact that RNA secondary structure
	has on substitution rates. Analyses on simulated sequences show that
	the new inference procedure has reasonable statistical properties.
	Potential applications of this procedure, including improved ancestral
	sequence inference and location of functionally interesting sites,
	are discussed.},

	virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been intensely studied, and hundreds of
	CTL epitopes have been experimentally defined, published, and compiled
	in the HIV Molecular Immunology Database. Maps of CTL epitopes on
	HIV-1 protein sequences reveal that defined epitopes tend to cluster.
	Here we integrate the global sequence and immunology databases to
	systematically explore the relationship between HIV-1 amino acid
	sequences and CTL epitope distributions. CTL responses to five HIV-1
	proteins, Gag p17, Gag p24, reverse transcriptase (RT), Env, and
	Nef, have been particularly well characterized in the literature
	to date. Through comparing CTL epitope distributions in these five
	proteins to global protein sequence alignments, we identified distinct
	characteristics of HIV amino acid sequences that correlate with CTL
	epitope localization. First, experimentally defined HIV CTL epitopes
	are concentrated in relatively conserved regions. Second, the highly
	variable regions that lack epitopes bear cumulative evidence of past
	immune escape that may make them relatively refractive to CTLs: a
	paucity of predicted proteasome processing sites and an enrichment
	for amino acids that do not serve as C-terminal anchor residues.
	Finally, CTL epitopes are more highly concentrated in alpha-helical
	regions of proteins. Based on amino acid sequence characteristics,
	in a blinded fashion, we predicted regions in HIV regulatory and
	accessory proteins that would be likely to contain CTL epitopes;
	these predictions were then validated by comparison to new sets of
	experimentally defined epitopes in HIV-1 Rev, Tat, Vif, and Vpr.},
