  abstract = {{Comparative methods analyses have usually assumed that the species
	phenotypes are the true means for those species. In most analyses,
	the actual values used are means of samples of modest size. The covariances
	of contrasts then involve both the covariance of evolutionary changes
	and a fraction of the within-species phenotypic covariance, the fraction
	depending on the sample size for that species. Ives et al. have shown
	how to analyze data in this case when the within-species phenotypic
	covariances are known. The present model allows them to be unknown
	and to be estimated from the data. A multivariate normal statistical
	model is used for multiple characters in samples of finite size from
	species related by a known phylogeny, under the usual Brownian motion
	model of change and with equal within-species phenotypic covariances.
	Contrasts in each character can be obtained both between individuals
	within a species and between species. Each contrast can be taken
	for all of the characters. These sets of contrasts, each the same
	contrast taken for different characters, are independent. The within-set
	covariances are unequal and depend on the unknown true covariance
	matrices. An expectation-maximization algorithm is derived for making
	a reduced maximum likelihood estimate of the covariances of evolutionary
	change and the within-species phenotypic covariances. It is available
	in the Contrast program of the PHYLIP package. Computer simulations
	show that the covariances are biased when the finiteness of sample
	size is not taken into account and that using the present model corrects
	the bias. Sampling variation reduces the power of inference of covariation
	in evolution of different characters. An extension of this method
	to incorporate estimates of additive genetic covariances from a simple
	genetic experiment is also discussed.}},

  abstract = {{A computer simulation study has been made of the accuracy of estimates
	of Theta = 4N(e)mu from a sample from a single isolated population
	of finite size. The accuracies turn out to be well predicted by a
	formula developed by Fu and Li, who used optimistic assumptions.
	Their formulas are restated in terms of accuracy, defined here as
	the reciprocal of the squared coefficient of variation. This should
	be proportional to sample size when the entities sampled provide
	independent information. Using these formulas for accuracy, the sampling
	strategy for estimation of Theta can be investigated. Two models
	for cost have been used, a cost-per-base model and a cost-per-read
	model. The former would lead us to prefer to have a very large number
	of loci, each one base long. The latter, which is more realistic,
	causes us to prefer to have one read per locus and an optimum sample
	size which declines as costs of sampling organisms increase. For
	realistic values, the optimum sample size is 8 or fewer individuals.
	This is quite close to the results obtained by Pluzhnikov and Donnelly
	for a cost-per-base model, evaluating other estimators of Theta It
	can be understood by considering that the resources spent collecting
	larger samples prevent us from considering more loci. An examination
	of the efficiency of Watterson's estimator of Theta was also made,
	and it was found to be reasonably efficient when the number of mutants
	per generation in the sequence in the whole population is less than
	2.5.}},

  abstract = {{As methods of molecular phylogeny have become more explicit and more
	biologically realistic following the pioneering work of Thomas Jukes,
	they have had to relax their initial assumption that rates of evolution
	were equal at all sites. Distance matrix and likelihood methods of
	inferring phylogenies make this assumption; parsimony, when valid,
	is less limited by it. Nucleotide sequences, including RNA sequences,
	can show substantial rate variation; protein sequences show rates
	that vary much more widely. Assuming a prior distribution of rates
	such as a gamma distribution or lognormal distribution has deservedly
	been popular, but for likelihood methods it leads to computational
	difficulties. These can be resolved using hidden Markov model (HMM)
	methods which approximate the distribution by one with a modest number
	of discrete rates. Generalized Laguerre quadrature can be used to
	improve the selection of rates and their probabilities so as to more
	nearly approach the desired gamma distribution. A model based on
	population genetics is presented predicting how the rates of evolution
	might vary from locus to locus. Challenges for the future include
	allowing rates at a given site to vary along the tree, as in the
	``covarion{''} model, and allowing them to have correlations that
	reflect three-dimensional structure, rather than position in the
	coding sequence. Markov chain Monte Carlo likelihood methods may
	be the only practical way to carry out computations for these models.}},

  abstract = {{A computational method is presented for minimizing the weighted sum
	of squares of the differences between observed and expected pairwise
	distances between species, where the expectations are generated by
	an additive tree model. The criteria of Pitch and Margoliash (1967,
	Science 155:279-284) and Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards (1967, Evolution
	21:550-570) are both weighted least squares, with different weights.
	The method presented iterates lengths of adjacent branches in the
	tree three at a time. The weighted sum of squares never increases
	during the process of iteration, and the iterates approach a stationary
	point on the surface of the sum of squares. This iterative approach
	makes it particularly easy to maintain the constraint that branch
	lengths never become negative, although negative branch lengths can
	also be allowed. The method is implemented in a computer program,
	FITCH, which has been distributed since 1982 as part of the PHYLIP
	package of programs for inferring phylogenies, and is also implemented
	in PAUP{*}. The present method is compared, using some simulated
	data sets, with an implementation of the method of De Soete (1983,
	Psychometrika 48:621-626); it is slower than De Soete's method but
	more effective at finding the least squares tree. The relationship
	of this method to the neighbor-joining method is also discussed.}},

	deal with any number of species. The computational methods for doing
	so are outlined. The resulting algorithms are slow but take multiple
	gains and losses of restriction sites fully into account, unlike
	parsimony methods. They allow for the failure to observe potential
	sites that are absent from all species. Analysis of the five-species
	hominoid data of Ferris and coworkers confirms the pattern found
	by Smouse and Li with four species-that a chimpanzee-gorilla clade
	is favored, but not statistically significantly over other tree topologies.
	A large data set produced by computer simulation has also been analyzed
	to confirm that the method works properly. The methods used here
	do not allow for different rates of transitions and transversions.
	They can be extended to do so, but only at a cost of considerably

	a sample of nucleotide sequences, within which there is assumed to
	be no recombination, allows estimation of the effective size of an
	isolated population. This paper investigates the case of very long
	sequences, where each pair of sequences allows a precise estimate
	of the divergence time of those two gene copies. The average divergence
	time of all pairs of copies estimates twice the effective population
	number and an estimate can also be derived from the number of segregating
	sites. One can alternatively estimate the genealogy of the copies.
	This paper shows how a maximum likelihood estimate of the effective
	population number can be derived from such a genealogical tree. The
	pairwise and the segregating sites estimates are shown to be much
	less efficient than this maximum likelihood estimate, and this is
	verified by computer simulation. The result implies that there is
	much to gain by explicitly taking the tree structure of these genealogies
	into account.}},

  abstract = {{We would like to use maximum likelihood to estimate parameters such
	as the effective population size N(e), or, if we do not know mutation
	rates, the product 4N(e)mu of mutation rate per site and effective
	population size. To compute the likelihood for a sample of unrecombined
	nucleotide sequences taken from a random-mating population it is
	necessary to sum over all genealogies that could have led to the
	sequences, computing for each one the probability that it would have
	yielded the sequences, and weighting each one by its prior probability.
	The genealogies vary in tree topology and in branch lengths. Although
	the likelihood and the prior are straightforward to compute, the
	summation over all genealogies seems at first sight hopelessly difficult.
	This paper reports that it is possible to carry out a Monte Carlo
	integration to evaluate the likelihoods approximately. The method
	uses bootstrap sampling of sites to create data sets for each of
	which a maximum likelihood tree is estimated. The resulting trees
	are assumed to be sampled from a distribution whose height is proportional
	to the likelihood surface for the full data. That it will be so is
	dependent on a theorem which is not proven, but seems likely to be
	true if the sequences are not short. One can use the resulting estimated
	likelihood curve to make a maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter
	of interest, N(e) or of 4N(e)mu. The method requires at least 100
	times the computational effort required for estimation of a phylogeny
	by maximum likelihood, but is practical on today's work stations.
	The method does not at present have any way of dealing with recombination.}},

  abstract = {As methods of molecular phylogeny have become more explicit and more
	biologically realistic following the pioneering work of Thomas Jukes,
	they have had to relax their initial assumption that rates of evolution
	were equal at all sites. Distance matrix and likelihood methods of
	inferring phylogenies make this assumption; parsimony, when valid,
	is less limited by it. Nucleotide sequences, including RNA sequences,
	can show substantial rate variation; protein sequences show rates
	that vary much more widely. Assuming a prior distribution of rates
	such as a gamma distribution or lognormal distribution has deservedly
	been popular, but for likelihood methods it leads to computational
	difficulties. These can be resolved using hidden Markov model (HMM)
	methods which approximate the distribution by one with a modest number
	of discrete rates. Generalized Laguerre quadrature can be used to
	improve the selection of rates and their probabilities so as to more
	nearly approach the desired gamma distribution. A model based on
	population genetics is presented predicting how the rates of evolution
	might vary from locus to locus. Challenges for the future include
	allowing rates at a given site to vary along the tree, as in the
	"covarion" model, and allowing them to have correlations that reflect
	three-dimensional structure, rather than position in the coding sequence.
	Markov chain Monte Carlo likelihood methods may be the only practical
	way to carry out computations for these models.},

	Rates of evolution at different sites are assumed to be drawn from
	a set of possible rates, with a finite number of possibilities. The
	overall likelihood of phylogeny is calculated as a sum of terms,
	each term being the probability of the data given a particular assignment
	of rates to sites, times the prior probability of that particular
	combination of rates. The probabilities of different rate combinations
	are specified by a stationary Markov chain that assigns rate categories
	to sites. While there will be a very large number of possible ways
	of assigning rates to sites, a simple recursive algorithm allows
	the contributions to the likelihood from all possible combinations
	of rates to be summed, in a time proportional to the number of different
	rates at a single site. Thus with three rates, the effort involved
	is no greater than three times that for a single rate. This `'Hidden
	Markov Model'' method allows for rates to differ between sites and
	for correlations between the rates of neighboring sites. By summing
	over all possibilities it does not require us to know the rates at
	individual sites. However, it does not allow for correlation of rates
	at nonadjacent sites, nor does it allow for a continuous distribution
	of rates over sites. It is shown how to use the Newton-Raphson method
	to estimate branch lengths of a phylogeny and to infer from a phylogeny
	what assignment of rates to sites has the largest posterior probability.
	An example is given using beta-hemoglobin DNA sequences in eight

	of effective population size and per-site mutation rate), which is
	related to the branch lengths of the reconstructed genealogy. With
	infinite amounts of data, ML models using SNP data are expected to
	produce consistent estimates of Theta. With finite amounts of data
	the estimates are accurate when Theta is high, but tend to be biased
	upward when Theta is low. If recombination is present and not allowed
	for in the analysis, the results are additionally biased upward,
	but this effect can be removed by incorporating recombination into
	the analysis. SNPs defined as sites that are polymorphic in the actual
	sample under consideration (sample SNPs) are somewhat more accurate
	for estimation of Theta than SNPs defined by their polymorphism in
	a panel chosen from the same population (panel SNPs). Misrepresenting
	panel SNPs as sample SNPs leads to large errors in the maximum likelihood
	estimate of Theta. Researchers collecting SNPs should collect and
	preserve information about the mettled of ascertainment so that the
	data can be accurately analyzed.}},

	for large trees. Thus, it gives an efficient way of obtaining the
	maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) for a given tree topology. Our
	method utilizes the differences accumulated by random genetic drift
	in allele count data from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
	ignoring the effect of mutation after divergence from the common
	ancestral population. The computation of the maximum-likelihood tree
	involves both maximizing likelihood over branch lengths of a given
	topology and comparing the maximum-likelihood across topologies.
	Here our focus is the maximization of likelihood over branch lengths
	of a given topology. The pruning algorithm computes arrays of probabilities
	at the root of the tree from the data at the tips of the tree; at
	the root, the arrays determine the likelihood. The arrays consist
	of probabilities related to the number of coalescences and allele
	counts for the partially coalesced lineages. Computing these probabilities
	requires an unusual two-stage algorithm. Our computation is exact
