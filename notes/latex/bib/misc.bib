  abstract = {Differences in the regional substitution patterns in the human genome
	created patterns of large-scale variation of base composition known
	as genomic isochores. To gain insight into the origin of the genomic
	isochores, we develop a maximum-likelihood approach to determine
	the history of substitution patterns in the human genome. This approach
	utilizes the vast amount of repetitive sequence deposited in the
	human genome over the past approximately 250 Myr. Using this approach,
	we estimate the frequencies of seven types of substitutions: the
	four transversions, two transitions, and the methyl-assisted transition
	of cytosine in CpG. Comparing substitutional patterns in repetitive
	elements of various ages, we reconstruct the history of the base-substitutional
	process in the different isochores for the past 250 Myr. At around
	90 MYA (around the time of the mammalian radiation), we find an abrupt
	fourfold to eightfold increase of the cytosine transition rate in
	CpG pairs compared with that of the reptilian ancestor. Further analysis
	of nucleotide substitutions in regions with different GC content
	reveals concurrent changes in the substitutional patterns. Although
	the substitutional pattern was dependent on the regional GC content
	in such ways that it preserved the regional GC content before the
	mammalian radiation, it lost this dependence afterward. The substitutional
	pattern changed from an isochore-preserving to an isochore-degrading
	one. We conclude that isochores have been established before the
	radiation of the eutherian mammals and have been subject to the process
	of homogenization since then.},

  abstract = {Many pathogen recognition genes, such as plant R-genes, undergo rapid
	adaptive evolution, providing evidence that these genes play a critical
	role in plant-pathogen coevolution. Surprisingly, whether rapid adaptive
	evolution also occurs in genes encoding other kinds of plant defense
	proteins is unknown. Unlike recognition proteins, plant chitinases
	attack pathogens directly, conferring disease resistance by degrading
	chitin, a component of fungal cell walls. Here, we show that nonsynonymous
	substitution rates in plant class I chitinase often exceed synonymous
	rates in the plant genus Arabis (Cruciferae) and in other dicots,
	indicating a succession of adaptively driven amino acid replacements.
	We identify individual residues that are likely subject to positive
	selection by using codon substitution models and determine the location
	of these residues on the three-dimensional structure of class I chitinase.
	In contrast to primate lysozymes and plant class III chitinases,
	structural and functional relatives of class I chitinase, the adaptive
	replacements of class I chitinase occur disproportionately in the
	active site cleft. This highly unusual pattern of replacements suggests
	that fungi directly defend against chitinolytic activity through
	enzymatic inhibition or other forms of chemical resistance and identifies
	target residues for manipulating chitinolytic activity. These data
	also provide empirical evidence that plant defense proteins not involved
	in pathogen recognition also evolve in a manner consistent with rapid
	coevolutionary interactions.},

  abstract = {The molecular clock does not tick at a uniform rate in all taxa but
	may be influenced by species characteristics. Eusocial species (those
	with reproductive division of labor) have been predicted to have
	faster rates of molecular evolution than their nonsocial relatives
	because of greatly reduced effective population size; if most individuals
	in a population are nonreproductive and only one or few queens produce
	all the offspring, then eusocial animals could have much lower effective
	population sizes than their solitary relatives, which should increase
	the rate of substitution of "nearly neutral" mutations. An earlier
	study reported faster rates in eusocial honeybees and vespid wasps
	but failed to correct for phylogenetic nonindependence or to distinguish
	between potential causes of rate variation. Because sociality has
	evolved independently in many different lineages, it is possible
	to conduct a more wide-ranging study to test the generality of the
	relationship. We have conducted a comparative analysis of 25 phylogenetically
	independent pairs of social lineages and their nonsocial relatives,
	including bees, wasps, ants, termites, shrimps, and mole rats, using
	a range of available DNA sequences (mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
	coding for proteins and RNAs, and nontranslated sequences). By including
	a wide range of social taxa, we were able to test whether there is
	a general influence of sociality on rates of molecular evolution
	and to test specific predictions of the hypothesis: (1) that social
	species have faster rates because they have reduced effective population
	sizes; (2) that mitochondrial genes would show a greater effect of
	sociality than nuclear genes; and (3) that rates of molecular evolution
	should be correlated with the degree of sociality. We find no consistent
	pattern in rates of molecular evolution between social and nonsocial
	lineages and no evidence that mitochondrial genes show faster rates
	in social taxa. However, we show that the most highly eusocial Hymenoptera
	do have faster rates than their nonsocial relatives. We also find
	that social parasites (that utilize the workers from related species
	to produce their own offspring) have faster rates than their social
	relatives, which is consistent with an effect of lower effective
	population size on rate of molecular evolution. Our results illustrate
	the importance of allowing for phylogenetic nonindependence when
	conducting investigations of determinants of variation in rate of
	molecular evolution.},

  abstract = {To study the genomic divergences among hominoids and to estimate the
	effective population size of the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees,
	we selected 53 autosomal intergenic nonrepetitive DNA segments from
	the human genome and sequenced them in a human, a chimpanzee, a gorilla,
	and an orangutan. The average sequence divergence was only 1.24\%
	+/- 0.07\% for the human-chimpanzee pair, 1.62\% +/- 0.08\% for the
	human-gorilla pair, and 1.63\% +/- 0.08\% for the chimpanzee-gorilla
	pair. These estimates, which were confirmed by additional data from
	GenBank, are substantially lower than previous ones, which included
	repetitive sequences and might have been based on less-accurate sequence
	data. The average sequence divergences between orangutans and humans,
	chimpanzees, and gorillas were 3.08\% +/- 0.11\%, 3.12\% +/- 0.11\%,
	and 3.09\% +/- 0.11\%, respectively, which also are substantially
	lower than previous estimates. The sequence divergences in other
	regions between hominoids were estimated from extensive data in GenBank
	and the literature, and Alus showed the highest divergence, followed
	in order by Y-linked noncoding regions, pseudogenes, autosomal intergenic
	regions, X-linked noncoding regions, synonymous sites, introns, and
	nonsynonymous sites. The neighbor-joining tree derived from the concatenated
	sequence of the 53 segments--24,234 bp in length--supports the Homo-Pan
	clade with a 100\% bootstrap value. However, when each segment is
	analyzed separately, 22 of the 53 segments (approximately 42\%) give
	a tree that is incongruent with the species tree, suggesting a large
	effective population size (N(e)) of the common ancestor of Homo and
	Pan. Indeed, a parsimony analysis of the 53 segments and 37 protein-coding
	genes leads to an estimate of N(e) = 52,000 to 96,000. As this estimate
	is 5 to 9 times larger than the long-term effective population size
	of humans (approximately 10,000) estimated from various genetic polymorphism
	data, the human lineage apparently had experienced a large reduction
	in effective population size after its separation from the chimpanzee
	lineage. Our analysis assumes a molecular clock, which is in fact
	supported by the sequence data used. Taking the orangutan speciation
	date as 12 to 16 million years ago, we obtain an estimate of 4.6
	to 6.2 million years for the Homo-Pan divergence and an estimate
	of 6.2 to 8.4 million years for the gorilla speciation date, suggesting
	that the gorilla lineage branched off 1.6 to 2.2 million years earlier
	than did the human-chimpanzee divergence.},

  abstract = {It is a central assumption of evolution that gene duplications provide
	the genetic raw material from which to create proteins with new functions.
	The increasing availability in multigene family sequences that has
	resulted from genome projects has inspired the creation of novel
	in silico approaches to predict details of protein function. The
	underlying principle of all such approaches is to compare the evolutionary
	properties of homologous sequence positions in paralogous proteins.
	It has been proposed that the positions that show switches in substitution
	rate over time-i.e., "heterotachous sites," are good indicators of
	functional divergence. Here, we analyzed the alpha and beta paralogous
	subunits of hemoglobin in search for such signatures. We found as
	many heterotachous sites in comparisons between groups of paralogous
	subunits (alpha/beta) as between orthologous ones (alpha/alpha, beta/beta).
	Thus, the importance of substitution rate shifts as predictors of
	specialization between protein subfamilies might be reconsidered.
	Instead, such shifts may reflect a more general process of protein
	evolution, consistent with the fact that they can be compatible with
	function conservation. As an alternative, we focused on those residues
	showing highly constrained states in two sequence groups, but different
	in each group, and we named them CBD (for "constant but different").
	As opposed to heterotachous positions, CBD sites were markedly overrepresented
	in paralogous (alpha/beta) comparisons, as opposed to orthologous
	ones (alpha/alpha, beta/beta), identifying them as likely signatures
	of functional specialization between the two subunits. When superimposed
	onto the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin, CBD positions
	consistently appeared to cluster preferentially on inter-subunit
	surfaces, two contact areas crucial to function in vertebrate tetrameric
	hemoglobin. The identification and analysis of CBD sites by complementing
	structural information with evolutionary data may represent a promising
	direction for future studies dealing with the functional characterization

	(Utricularia) trap plankton when water-immersed, negatively pressured

	from the quaternary structure of bovine COX, the most profound adaptive
	substitutions are two contiguous cysteines absent in approximately
	99.9\% of databased COX I sequences from Eukaryota, Archaea, and
	Bacteria. This motif lies directly at the docking point of COX I
	helix 3 and cytochrome c, and modeling of bovine COX I suggests the
	possibility of an unprecedented helix-terminating disulfide bridge

  abstract = {Associations between selected alleles and the genetic backgrounds
	on which they are found can reduce the efficacy of selection. We
	consider the extent to which such interference, known as the Hill-Robertson
	effect, acting between weakly selected alleles, can restrict molecular
	adaptation and affect patterns of polymorphism and divergence. In
	particular, we focus on synonymous-site mutations, considering the
	fate of novel variants in a two-locus model and the equilibrium effects
	of interference with multiple loci and reversible mutation. We find
	that weak selection Hill-Robertson (wsHR) interference can considerably
	reduce adaptation, e.g., codon bias, and, to a lesser extent, levels
	of polymorphism, particularly in regions of low recombination. Interference
	causes the frequency distribution of segregating sites to resemble
	that expected from more weakly selected mutations and also generates
	specific patterns of linkage disequilibrium. While the selection
	coefficients involved are small, the fitness consequences of wsHR
	interference across the genome can be considerable. We suggest that
	wsHR interference is an important force in the evolution of nonrecombining
	genomes and may explain the unexpected constancy of codon bias across
	species of very different census population sizes, as well as several
	unusual features of codon usage in Drosophila.},

  abstract = {Functional redundancy between duplicated genes is predicted to be
	transitory, as one gene either loses its function or gains a new
	function, or both genes accrue degenerative, yet complimentary mutations.
	Yet there are many examples where functional redundancy has been
	maintained between gene duplicates. To determine whether selection
	is acting on functionally redundant gene duplicates, we performed
	molecular evolution and population genetic analyses between two pairs
	of functionally redundant MADS-box genes from the model plant Arabidopsis
	thaliana: SEPALLATA1 (SEP1) and SEPALLATA2 (SEP2), involved in floral
	organ identity, and SHATTERPROOF1 (SHP1) and SHATTERPROOF2 (SHP2),
	involved in seed shattering. We found evidence for purifying selection
	acting to constrain functional divergence between paralogous genes.
	The protein evolution of both pairs of duplicate genes is functionally
	constrained, as evidenced by Ka/Ks ratios of 0.16 between paralogs.
	This functional constraint is stronger in the highly conserved DNA-binding
	and protein-binding MIK region than in the C-terminal region. We
	also assayed the evolutionary forces acting between orthologs of
	the SEP and SHP genes in A. thaliana and the closely related species,
	Arabidopsis lyrata. Heterogeneity analyses of the polymorphism-to-divergence
	ratio indicate selective sweeps have occurred within the transcriptional
	unit of SHP1 and the promoter of SHP2 in the A. thaliana lineage.
	Similar analyses identified a significant reduction in polymorphism
	within the SEP1 locus, spanning the 3' region of intron 1 to exon
	3, that may represent an intragenic sweep within the SEP1 locus.
	We discuss whether the evolutionary forces acting on SEP1 and SEP2
	versus SHP1 and SHP2 vary according to their position in the floral
	developmental pathway, as found with other floral-regulatory genes.},

  month = {Aug},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The binding sites of sequence specific transcription factors
	are an important and relatively well-understood class of functional
	non-coding DNAs. Although a wide variety of experimental and computational
	methods have been developed to characterize transcription factor
	binding sites, they remain difficult to identify. Comparison of non-coding
	DNA from related species has shown considerable promise in identifying
	these functional non-coding sequences, even though relatively little
	is known about their evolution. RESULTS: Here we analyse the genome
	sequences of the budding yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. bayanus,
	S. paradoxus and S. mikatae to study the evolution of transcription
	factor binding sites. As expected, we find that both experimentally
	characterized and computationally predicted binding sites evolve
	slower than surrounding sequence, consistent with the hypothesis
	that they are under purifying selection. We also observe position-specific
	variation in the rate of evolution within binding sites. We find
	that the position-specific rate of evolution is positively correlated
	with degeneracy among binding sites within S. cerevisiae. We test
	theoretical predictions for the rate of evolution at positions where
	the base frequencies deviate from background due to purifying selection
	and find reasonable agreement with the observed rates of evolution.
	Finally, we show how the evolutionary characteristics of real binding
	motifs can be used to distinguish them from artefacts of computational
	motif finding algorithms. CONCLUSION: As has been observed for protein
	sequences, the rate of evolution in transcription factor binding
	sites varies with position, suggesting that some regions are under
	stronger functional constraint than others. This variation likely
	reflects the varying importance of different positions in the formation
	of the protein-DNA complex. The characterization of the pattern of
	evolution in known binding sites will likely contribute to the effective
	use of comparative sequence data in the identification of transcription
	factor binding sites and is an important step toward understanding
	the evolution of functional non-coding DNA.},

	families. Mixtures of different distributions can capture more complex
	patterns of rate variation, but are often parameter-rich and difficult

	rate distribution, such as a gamma distribution, is discretized into
	several categories, the quantiles of which are estimated using a
	discretized beta distribution. Although this approach involves adding
	only two extra parameters to a standard distribution, a wide range
	of rate distributions can be captured. Using simulated data, we demonstrate
	that a "beta-" model can reproduce the moments of the rate distribution
	more accurately than the distribution used to simulate the data,
	even when the baseline rate distribution is misspecified. Using hepatitis
	C virus and mammalian mitochondrial sequences, we show that a beta-
	model can fit as well or better than a model with multiple discrete
	rate categories, and compares favorably with a model which fits a

	examine the performance of an autocorrelation model of evolutionary

	at all sites of the protein. High correlation is expected, for example,
	in linear functional domains. On the other hand, when we consider
	nonlinear functional regions (e.g., active sites), low correlation
	is expected because the interaction between distant sites imposes
	independence of rates in the linear sequence. Our model is based

	regions of the protein and rate independence at others. We study
	the differences between the novel model and models which assume either

  abstract = {The nearly neutral theory predicts that the rate and pattern of molecular
	evolution will be influenced by effective population size (Ne), because
	in small populations more slightly deleterious mutations are expected
	to drift to fixation. This important prediction has not been widely
	empirically tested, largely because of the difficulty of comparing
	rates of molecular evolution in sufficient numbers of independent
	lineages which differ only in Ne. Island endemic species provide
	an ideal test of the effect of Ne on molecular evolution because
	species restricted to islands frequently have smaller Ne than closely
	related mainland species, and island endemics have arisen from mainland
	lineages many times in a wide range of taxa. We collated a dataset
	of 70 phylogenetically independent comparisons between island and
	mainland taxa, including vertebrates, invertebrates and plants, from
	19 different island groups. The rate of molecular evolution in these
	lineages was estimated by maximum likelihood using two measures:
	overall substitution rate and the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous
	substitution rates. We show that island lineages have significantly
	higher ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates
	than mainland lineages, as predicted by the nearly neutral theory,
	although overall substitution rates do not differ significantly.},

  abstract = {Gene expression is central to the genotype-phenotype relationship
	in all organisms, and it is an important component of the genetic
	basis for evolutionary change in diverse aspects of phenotype. However,
	the evolution of transcriptional regulation remains understudied
	and poorly understood. Here we review the evolutionary dynamics of
	promoter, or cis-regulatory, sequences and the evolutionary mechanisms
	that shape them. Existing evidence indicates that populations harbor
	extensive genetic variation in promoter sequences, that a substantial
	fraction of this variation has consequences for both biochemical
	and organismal phenotype, and that some of this functional variation
	is sorted by selection. As with protein-coding sequences, rates and
	patterns of promoter sequence evolution differ considerably among
	loci and among clades for reasons that are not well understood. Studying
	the evolution of transcriptional regulation poses empirical and conceptual
	challenges beyond those typically encountered in analyses of coding
	sequence evolution: promoter organization is much less regular than
	that of coding sequences, and sequences required for the transcription
	of each locus reside at multiple other loci in the genome. Because
	of the strong context-dependence of transcriptional regulation, sequence
	inspection alone provides limited information about promoter function.
	Understanding the functional consequences of sequence differences
	among promoters generally requires biochemical and in vivo functional
	assays. Despite these challenges, important insights have already
	been gained into the evolution of transcriptional regulation, and
	the pace of discovery is accelerating.},
