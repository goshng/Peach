  abstract = {Point mutations are generally assumed to involve changes of single
	nucleotides. Nevertheless, the nature and known mechanisms of mutation
	do not exclude the possibility that several adjacent nucleotides
	may change simultaneously in a single mutational event. Two independent
	approaches are used here to estimate the frequency of simultaneous
	double-nucleotide substitutions. The first examines switches between
	TCN and AGY (where N is any nucleotide and Y is a pyrimidine) codons
	encoding absolutely conserved serine residues in a number of proteins
	from diverse organisms. The second reveals double-nucleotide substitutions
	in primate noncoding sequences. These two complementary approaches
	provide similar high estimates for the rate of doublet substitutions,
	on the order of 0.1 per site per billion years.},

	nucleotides and radical/conservative amino acids) following duplication.
	Most substitutions between paralogs in Euplotes crassus, Halteria
	grandinella and Paramecium tetraurelia are synonymous. In contrast,
	alpha-tubulin paralogs within Stylonychia lemnae and Chilodonella
	uncinata are evolving at significantly different rates and have higher
	ratios of both replacement substitutions to synonymous substitutions
	and radical amino acid changes to conservative amino acid changes.
	Moreover, the amino acid substitutions in C. uncinata and S. lemnae
	paralogs are limited to short stretches that correspond to functionally
	important regions of the alpha-tubulin protein. The topology of ciliate
	alpha-tubulin genealogies are inconsistent with taxonomy based on

	evolution of this essential eukaryotic protein. We analyzed histone
	H4 sequences from 13 species of ciliates and compared these data
	with sequences from well-sampled eukaryotic clades. Ciliate histone
	H4s differ from one another at as many as 46\% of their amino acids,
	in contrast with the highly conserved character of this protein in
	most other eukaryotes. Equally striking, we find paralogs of histone
	H4 within ciliate genomes that differ by up to 25\% of their amino
	acids, whereas paralogs in other eukaryotes share identical or nearly
	identical amino acid sequences. Moreover, the most divergent H4 proteins
	within ciliates are found in the lineages with highly processed macronuclear
	genomes. Our analyses demonstrate that the dual nature of ciliate
	genomes-the presence of a "germline" micronucleus and a "somatic"
	macronucleus within each cell-allowed the dramatic variation in ciliate
	histone genes by altering functional constraints or enabling adaptive
	evolution of the histone H4 protein, or both.},

	variation data from a approximately 10-kilobase noncoding autosomal
	region. We identified 75 variant sites in 64 humans (128 sequences)
	and 463 variant sites among the human, chimpanzee, and orangutan
	sequences. Statistical tests suggested that the region is selectively
	neutral. The average nucleotide diversity (pi) across the region
	was 0.088\% among all of the human sequences obtained, 0.085\% among

	the view of a low nucleotide diversity ( approximately 0.1\%) in

	indicates no severe bottleneck during the evolution of modern non-Africans;
	however, the possibility of a mild bottleneck cannot be excluded
	because non-Africans showed considerably fewer variants than Africans.
	The present and two previous large data sets all show a strong excess

	expansion. The mutation rate was estimated to be 1.15 x 10(-9) per
	nucleotide per year. Estimates of the long-term effective population

	sequences, providing the first evidence from a noncoding autosomal
