  abstract = {The ancestral selection graph in population genetics was introduced
	by Krone and Neuhauser [Krone, S.M., Neuhauser, C., 1997. Ancestral
	process with selection. Theor. Popul. Biol. 51, 210-237] as an analogue
	of the coalescent genealogy of a sample of genes from a neutrally
	evolving population. The number of particles in this graph, followed
	backwards in time, is a birth and death process with quadratic death
	and linear birth rates. In this paper an explicit form of the probability
	distribution of the number of particles is obtained by using the
	density of the allele frequency in the corresponding diffusion model
	obtained by Kimura [Kimura, M., 1955. Stochastic process and distribution
	of gene frequencies under natural selection. Cold Spring Harbor Symposia
	on Quantitative Biology 20, 33-53]. It is shown that the process
	of fixation of the allele in the diffusion model corresponds to convergence
	of the ancestral process to its stationary measure. The time to fixation
	of the allele conditional on fixation is studied in terms of the
	ancestral process.},
