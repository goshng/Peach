  abstract = {Understanding the factors that contribute to the formation of population
	genetic structure is a central goal of phylogeographic research,
	but achieving this goal can be complicated by the stochastic variance
	inherent to genetic processes. Statistical approaches to testing
	phylogeographic hypotheses accommodate this stochasticity by evaluating
	competing models of putative historical population structure, often
	by simulating null distributions of the expected variance. The effectiveness
	of these tests depends on the biological realism of the models. Information
	from the fossil record can aid in reconstructing the historical distributions
	of some taxa. However, for the majority of taxa, which lack sufficient
	fossils, paleodistributional modeling can provide valuable spatial-geographic
	data concerning ancestral distributions. Paleodistributional models
	are generated by projecting ecological niche models, which predict
	the current distribution of each species, onto a model of past climatic
	conditions. Here, we generate paleodistributional models describing
	the suitable habitat during the last glacial maximum for lineages
	from the mesic forests of the Pacific Northwest of North America,
	and use these models to generate alternative phylogeographic hypotheses.
	Coalescent simulations are then used to test these hypotheses to
	improve our understanding of the historical events that promoted
	the formation of population genetic structure in this ecosystem.
	Results from Pacific Northwest mesic forest organisms demonstrate
	the utility of these combined approaches. Paleodistribution models
	and population genetic structure are congruent across three amphibian
	lineages, suggesting that they have responded in a concerted manner
	to environmental change. Two other species, a willow and a water
	vole, despite being currently codistributed and having similar population
	genetic structure, were predicted by the paleodistributional model
	to have had markedly different distributions during the last glacial
	maximum. This suggests that congruent phylogeographic patterns can
	arise from incongruent ancestral distributions. Paleodistributional
	models introduce a much-needed spatial-geographic perspective to
	statistical phylogeography. In conjunction with coalescent models
	of population genetic structure, they have the potential to improve
	our understanding of the factors that promote population divergence
	and ultimately produce regional patterns of biodiversity.},

  abstract = {The infinitely-many-sites process is often used to model the sequence
	variability observed in samples of DNA sequences. Despite its popularity,
	the sampling theory of the process is rather poorly understood. We
	describe the tree structure underlying the model and show how this
	may be used to compute the probability of a sample of sequences.
	We show how to produce the unrooted genealogy from a set of sites
	in which the ancestral labeling is unknown and from this the corresponding
	rooted genealogies. We derive recursions for the probability of the
	configuration of sequences (equivalently, of trees) in both the rooted
	and unrooted cases. We give a computational method based on Monte
	Carlo recursion that provides approximates to sampling probabilities
	for samples of any size. Among several applications, this algorithm
	may be used to find maximum likelihood estimators of the substitution
	rate, both when the ancestral labeling of sites is known and when
	it is unknown.},

  abstract = {Admixture mapping (also known as "mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium,"
	or MALD) has been proposed as an efficient approach to localizing
	disease-causing variants that differ in frequency (because of either
	drift or selection) between two historically separated populations.
	Near a disease gene, patient populations descended from the recent
	mixing of two or more ethnic groups should have an increased probability
	of inheriting the alleles derived from the ethnic group that carries
	more disease-susceptibility alleles. The central attraction of admixture
	mapping is that, since gene flow has occurred recently in modern
	populations (e.g., in African and Hispanic Americans in the past
	20 generations), it is expected that admixture-generated linkage
	disequilibrium should extend for many centimorgans. High-resolution
	marker sets are now becoming available to test this approach, but
	progress will require (a). computational methods to infer ancestral
	origin at each point in the genome and (b). empirical characterization
	of the general properties of linkage disequilibrium due to admixture.
	Here we describe statistical methods to estimate the ancestral origin
	of a locus on the basis of the composite genotypes of linked markers,
	and we show that this approach accurately estimates states of ancestral
	origin along the genome. We apply this approach to show that strong
	admixture linkage disequilibrium extends, on average, for 17 cM in
	African Americans. Finally, we present power calculations under varying
	models of disease risk, sample size, and proportions of ancestry.
	Studying approximately 2500 markers in approximately 2500 patients
	should provide power to detect many regions contributing to common
	disease. A particularly important result is that the power of an
	admixture mapping study to detect a locus will be nearly the same
	for a wide range of mixture scenarios: the mixture proportion should
	be 10\%-90\% from both ancestral populations.},
