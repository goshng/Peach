  abstract = {The distribution of genetic polymorphisms in a population contains
	information about evolutionary processes. The Poisson random field
	(PRF) model uses the polymorphism frequency spectrum to infer the
	mutation rate and the strength of directional selection. The PRF
	model relies on an infinite-sites approximation that is reasonable
	for most eukaryotic populations, but that becomes problematic when
	is large ( greater, similar 0.05). Here, we show that at large mutation
	rates characteristic of microbes and viruses the infinite-sites approximation
	of the PRF model induces systematic biases that lead it to underestimate
	negative selection pressures and mutation rates and erroneously infer
	positive selection. We introduce two new methods that extend our
	ability to infer selection pressures and mutation rates at large
	: a finite-site modification of the PRF model and a new technique
	based on diffusion theory. Our methods can be used to infer not only
	a "weighted average" of selection pressures acting on a gene sequence,
	but also the distribution of selection pressures across sites. We
	evaluate the accuracy of our methods, as well that of the original
	PRF approach, by comparison with Wright-Fisher simulations.},

  title = {The population genetics of dN/dS.},
  journal = {PLoS Genet},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {e1000304},
  number = {12},
  month = {Dec},
  abstract = {Evolutionary pressures on proteins are often quantified by the ratio
	of substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites. The
	dN/dS ratio was originally developed for application to distantly
	diverged sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions
	that have fixed along independent lineages. Nevertheless, the dN/dS
	measure is often applied to sequences sampled from a single population,
	the differences among which represent segregating polymorphisms.
	Here, we study the expected dN/dS ratio for samples drawn from a
	single population under selection, and we find that in this context,
	dN/dS is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Moreover,
	the hallmark signature of positive selection over divergent lineages,
	dN/dS>1, is violated within a population. For population samples,
	the relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic
	function, and so it may be impossible to infer selection pressures
	from dN/dS. These results have significant implications for the interpretation
	of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples.},
