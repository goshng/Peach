  abstract = {It is believed that most modern mammalian lineages arose from a series
	of rapid speciation events near the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.
	It is shown that such a phylogeny makes the common ancestral genome
	sequence an ideal target for reconstruction. Simulations suggest
	that with methods currently available, we can expect to get 98\%
	of the bases correct in reconstructing megabase-scale euchromatic
	regions of an eutherian ancestral genome from the genomes of approximately
	20 optimally chosen modern mammals. Using actual genomic sequences
	from 19 extant mammals, we reconstruct 1.1 Mb of ancient genome sequence
	around the CFTR locus. Detailed examination suggests the reconstruction
	is accurate and that it allows us to identify features in modern
	species, such as remnants of ancient transposon insertions, that
	were not identified by direct analysis. Tracing the predicted evolutionary
	history of the bases in the reconstructed region, estimates are made
	of the amount of DNA turnover due to insertion, deletion, and substitution
	in the different placental mammalian lineages since the common eutherian
	ancestor, showing considerable variation between lineages. In coming
	years, such reconstructions may help in identifying and understanding
	the genetic features common to eutherian mammals and may shed light
	on the evolution of human or primate-specific traits.},

  abstract = {The ancestors of the archosaurs, a major branch of the diapsid reptiles,
	originated more than 240 MYA near the dawn of the Triassic Period.
	We used maximum likelihood phylogenetic ancestral reconstruction
	methods and explored different models of evolution for inferring
	the amino acid sequence of a putative ancestral archosaur visual
	pigment. Three different types of maximum likelihood models were
	used: nucleotide-based, amino acid-based, and codon-based models.
	Where possible, within each type of model, likelihood ratio tests
	were used to determine which model best fit the data. Ancestral reconstructions
	of the ancestral archosaur node using the best-fitting models of
	each type were found to be in agreement, except for three amino acid
	residues at which one reconstruction differed from the other two.
	To determine if these ancestral pigments would be functionally active,
	the corresponding genes were chemically synthesized and then expressed
	in a mammalian cell line in tissue culture. The expressed artificial
	genes were all found to bind to 11-cis-retinal to yield stable photoactive
	pigments with lambda(max) values of about 508 nm, which is slightly
	redshifted relative to that of extant vertebrate pigments. The ancestral
	archosaur pigments also activated the retinal G protein transducin,
	as measured in a fluorescence assay. Our results show that ancestral
	genes from ancient organisms can be reconstructed de novo and tested
	for function using a combination of phylogenetic and biochemical
	methods.},

  title = {Detecting compensatory covariation signals in protein evolution using
	reconstructed ancestral sequences.},
  journal = {J Mol Biol},
  year = {2002},
  volume = {319},
  pages = {729--743},
  number = {3},
  month = {Jun},
  abstract = {When protein sequences divergently evolve under functional constraints,
	some individual amino acid replacements that reverse the charge (e.g.
	Lys to Asp) may be compensated by a replacement at a second position
	that reverses the charge in the opposite direction (e.g. Glu to Arg).
	When these side-chains are near in space (proximal), such double
	replacements might be driven by natural selection, if either is selectively
	disadvantageous, but both together restore fully the ability of the
	protein to contribute to fitness (are together "neutral"). Accordingly,
	many have sought to identify pairs of positions in a protein sequence
	that suffer compensatory replacements, often as a way to identify
	positions near in space in the folded structure. A "charge compensatory
	signal" might manifest itself in two ways. First, proximal charge
	compensatory replacements may occur more frequently than predicted
	from the product of the probabilities of individual positions suffering
	charge reversing replacements independently. Conversely, charge compensatory
	pairs of changes may be observed to occur more frequently in proximal
	pairs of sites than in the average pair. Normally, charge compensatory
	covariation is detected by comparing the sequences of extant proteins
	at the "leaves" of phylogenetic trees. We show here that the charge
	compensatory signal is more evident when it is sought by examining
	individual branches in the tree between reconstructed ancestral sequences
	at nodes in the tree. Here, we find that the signal is especially
	strong when the positions pairs are in a single secondary structural
	unit (e.g. alpha helix or beta strand) that brings the side-chains
	suffering charge compensatory covariation near in space, and may
	be useful in secondary structure prediction. Also, "node-node" and
	"node-leaf" compensatory covariation may be useful to identify the
	better of two equally parsimonious trees, in a way that is independent
	of the mathematical formalism used to construct the tree itself.
	Further, compensatory covariation may provide a signal that indicates
	whether an episode of sequence evolution contains more or less divergence
	in functional behavior. Compensatory covariation analysis on reconstructed
	evolutionary trees may become a valuable tool to analyze genome sequences,
	and use these analyses to extract biomedically useful information
	from proteome databases.},

	come from the Karonga District in Malawi and include some of the
	earliest known subtype C sequences. Linear regression analyses of
	sequence divergence estimates (with four different approaches) were
	plotted against sample year to estimate the year in which there was
	zero divergence from the reconstructed ancestral sequence. Here we
	suggest that the most recent common ancestor of subtype C appeared
	in the mid- to late 1960s. Sensitivity analyses, by which possible
	biases due to oversampling from one district were explored, gave
	very similar estimates.},
