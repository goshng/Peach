  abstract = {Explosive growth of short-read sequencing technologies in the recent
	years resulted in rapid development of many new alignment algorithms
	and programs. But most of them are not efficient or not applicable
	for reads ?200 bp because these algorithms specifically designed
	to process short queries with relatively low sequencing error rates.
	However, the current trend to increase reliability of detection of
	structural variations in assembled genomes as well as to facilitate
	de novo sequencing demand complimenting high-throughput short-read
	platforms with long-read mapping. Thus, algorithms and programs for
	efficient mapping of longer reads are becoming crucial. However,
	the choice of long-read aligners effective in terms of both performance
	and memory are limited and includes only handful of hash table (BLAT,
	SSAHA2) or trie (Burrows-Wheeler Transform - Smith-Waterman (BWT-SW),
	Burrows-Wheeler Alignerr - Smith-Waterman (BWA-SW)) based algorithms.New
	O(n) algorithm that combines the advantages of both hash and trie-based
	methods has been designed to effectively align long biological sequences
	(?200 bp) against a large sequence database with small memory footprint
	(e.g. ~2 GB for the human genome). The algorithm is accurate and
	significantly more fast than BLAT or BWT-SW, but similar to BWT-SW
	it can find all local alignments. It is as accurate as SSAHA2 or
	BWA-SW, but uses 3+ times less memory and 10+ times faster than SSAHA2,
	several times faster than BWA-SW with low error rates and almost
	two times less memory. Availability and implementation: The prototype
	implementation of the algorithm will be available upon request for
	non-commercial use in academia (local hit table binary and indices
	are at ftp://styx.ucsd.edu).vit@ucsd.eduSupplementary data are available
	at Bioinformatics online.},
