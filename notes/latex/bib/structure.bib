  abstract = {Mutational experiments show how changes in the hydrophobic cores of
	proteins affect their stabilities. Here, we estimate these effects
	computationally, using four-body likelihood potentials obtained by
	simplicial neighborhood analysis of protein packing (SNAPP). In this
	procedure, the volume of a known protein structure is tiled with
	tetrahedra having the center of mass of one amino acid side-chain
	at each vertex. Log-likelihoods are computed for the 8855 possible
	tetrahedra with equivalent compositions from structural databases
	and amino acid frequencies. The sum of these four-body potentials
	for tetrahedra present in a given protein yields the SNAPP score.
	Mutations change this sum by changing the compositions of tetrahedra
	containing the mutated residue and their related potentials. Linear
	correlation coefficients between experimental mutational stability
	changes, Delta(DeltaG(unfold)), and those based on SNAPP scoring
	range from 0.70 to 0.94 for hydrophobic core mutations in five different
	proteins. Accurate predictions for the effects of hydrophobic core
	mutations can therefore be obtained by virtual mutagenesis, based
	on changes to the total SNAPP likelihood potential. Significantly,
	slopes of the relation between Delta(DeltaG(unfold)) and DeltaSNAPP
	for different proteins are statistically distinct, and we show that
	these protein-specific effects can be estimated using the average
	SNAPP score per residue, which is readily derived from the analysis
	itself. This result enhances the predictive value of statistical
	potentials and supports previous suggestions that "comparable" mutations
	in different proteins may lead to different Delta(DeltaG(unfold))
	values because of differences in their flexibility and/or conformational
	entropy.},

  pages = {1141--1152},

  month = {Apr},
  abstract = {We describe a new approach, based on the energy of non-local interactions,
	to assess protein structures. The method uses a very sensitive and
	accurate atomic mean force potential (AMFP) to calculate the non-local
	energy profile (NL-profile) of a proteins structure. Several protein
	models, built using the comparative modeling technique and containing
	several errors, were evaluated. These models exhibit a good stereochemistry
	and have been previously checked with different, widely used, methods
	that failed to detect the errors. The AMFP-derived energy profiles
	are able to correlate high scores with point errors and misalignments
	in the models. The point errors are frequently found in loops or
	regions of structural differences between the template and the target
	protein. The misalignments are clearly detected with very high scores.The
	performance of the method was also tested for the assessment of X-ray
	solved protein structures. In a data set of 143 well solved and non-redundant
	protein structures, we find that the average energy Z-scores, obtained
	from AMFP, increase as the resolution decreases. In the case of structures
	that have already been described as having an unusual stereochemistry,
	very high Z-scores are obtained. Moreover, energy calculations for
	some pairs of obsolete and replacement proteins always show higher
	Z-scores for the obsolete proteins. Finally, two particular cases
	show the usefulness of the profiles in the assessment of X-ray solved
	protein structures. First, the NL-profile of a protein structure
	refined in the incorrect space group has very high scores in several
	regions. One region has already been described to be out-of-register
	with the density map of the structure. The NL-profile of the re-refined
	structure with the correct space group is vastly improved. In the
	second case, the method is able to accurately point out disordered
	residues, even if the atoms of these residues do not violate the
	sum of the van der Waals radii. ANOLEA, the program used to calculate
	the NL-profile of a protein structure containing one or more chains
	is accessible through the World Wide Web at: http://www.fundp.ac.be/pub/ANOLEA.html.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach at the atomic level for the development
	of knowledge-based mean force potentials (MFPs) that can be used
	in fold recognition, ab initio structure prediction, comparative
	modelling and molecular recognition. Our method is based on atom-type
	definitions, raising the total frequency of the pairwise distributions
	and leading to very accurate and specific distance-dependent energy
	functions. Forty different heavy atom types were defined depending
	on their bond connectivity, chemical nature and location level (side-chain
	or backbone). Using this approach it has been possible to obtain
	average frequencies of pairwise contacts about 15 times higher than
	the ones obtained using the classic way of one heavy atom definition
	for each amino acid (i.e. alpha-carbon, beta-carbon, virtual centroid
	or virtual beta-carbon co-ordinates). In this paper we use this approach
	to develop a MFP that can be used in fold recognition and we compare
	it with a classic MFP at the amino acid level compiled from the alpha-carbon
	distances between the different amino acid pairs. Both potentials
	involve all the pairwise contacts extracted from a non-redundant
	folds database of 180 protein chains with a sequence identity threshold
	of 25\%. The pairwise energy functions of the MFP at the atomic level
	have a deep and very well defined minimum for each pairwise interaction,
	in contrast to the same curves obtained from the MFP developed at
	the amino acid level, which generally have multiple minima with similar
	depth. Our results also show that this MFP is able to produce very
	similar energy profiles for couples of proteins that share a very
	low sequence identity but are closely related at the structural level.
	When these profiles are plotted considering the structure-structure
	alignment, they are mostly superimposed, showing a correlation with
	the structure-structure similarity. In the same test, the MFP at
	the amino acid level fails to produce similar profiles. We suggest
	that using this MFP at the atomic level in the last stages of fold
	recognition or threading, when some candidates are available, can
	improve the sequence-structure alignments and, therefore, the final
	models. We also discuss the possibility of using this approach in
	the development of new MFPs to be used in ab initio structure prediction,
	comparative modelling and molecular recognition procedures.},

  pages = {430--448},
  number = {2},
  month = {Feb},
  abstract = {A protein structure model generally needs to be evaluated to assess
	whether or not it has the correct fold. To improve fold assessment,
	four types of a residue-level statistical potential were optimized,
	including distance-dependent, contact, Phi/Psi dihedral angle, and
	accessible surface statistical potentials. Approximately 10,000 test
	models with the correct and incorrect folds were built by automated
	comparative modeling of protein sequences of known structure. The
	criterion used to discriminate between the correct and incorrect
	models was the Z-score of the model energy. The performance of a
	Z-score was determined as a function of many variables in the derivation
	and use of the corresponding statistical potential. The performance
	was measured by the fractions of the correctly and incorrectly assessed
	test models. The most discriminating combination of any one of the
	four tested potentials is the sum of the normalized distance-dependent
	and accessible surface potentials. The distance-dependent potential
	that is optimal for assessing models of all sizes uses both C(alpha)
	and C(beta) atoms as interaction centers, distinguishes between all
	20 standard residue types, has the distance range of 30 A, and is
	derived and used by taking into account the sequence separation of
	the interacting atom pairs. The terms for the sequentially local
	interactions are significantly less informative than those for the
	sequentially nonlocal interactions. The accessible surface potential
	that is optimal for assessing models of all sizes uses C(beta) atoms
	as interaction centers and distinguishes between all 20 standard
	residue types. The performance of the tested statistical potentials
	is not likely to improve significantly with an increase in the number
	of known protein structures used in their derivation. The parameters
	of fold assessment whose optimal values vary significantly with model
	size include the size of the known protein structures used to derive
	the potential and the distance range of the accessible surface potential.
	Fold assessment by statistical potentials is most difficult for the
	very small models. This difficulty presents a challenge to fold assessment
	in large-scale comparative modeling, which produces many small and
	incomplete models. The results described in this study provide a
	basis for an optimal use of statistical potentials in fold assessment.},

	We generated decoys by gapless threading, and we derive energy parameters

	to the energy, defined in several ways, and showed that the additional
	hydrophobic terms enlarge slightly the number of proteins that can

	profile (SP(2)). SP(3) was tested in SALIGN benchmark for alignment
	accuracy and Lindahl, PROSPECTOR 3.0, and LiveBench 8.0 benchmarks
	for remote-homology detection and model accuracy. SP(3) is found
	to be the most sensitive and accurate single-method server in all
	benchmarks tested where other methods are available for comparison
	(although its results are statistically indistinguishable from the
	next best in some cases and the comparison is subjected to the limitation
	of time-dependent sequence and/or structural library used by different
