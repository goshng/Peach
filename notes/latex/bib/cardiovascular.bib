  abstract = {CONTEXT: C-reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammation protein that
	may play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
	OBJECTIVE: To assess whether polymorphisms in the CRP gene are associated
	with plasma CRP, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), and CVD events.
	DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In the prospective, population-based
	Cardiovascular Health Study, 4 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms
	(SNPs) (1919A/T, 2667G/C, 3872G/A, 5237A/G) were genotyped in 3941
	white (European American) participants and 5 tag SNPs (addition of
	790A/T) were genotyped in 700 black (African American) participants,
	aged 65 years or older, all of whom were without myocardial infarction
	(MI) or stroke before study entry. Median follow-up was 13 years
	(1989-2003). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Baseline CIMT; occurrence of
	MI, stroke, and CVD mortality during follow-up. RESULTS: In white
	participants, 461 incident MIs, 491 incident strokes, and 490 CVD-related
	deaths occurred; in black participants, 67 incident MIs, 78 incident
	strokes, and 75 CVD-related deaths occurred. The 1919T and 790T alleles
	were associated with higher CRP levels in white and black participants,
	respectively. The 3872A allele was associated with lower CRP levels
	in both populations, and the 2667C allele was associated with lower
	CRP levels in white participants only. There was no association between
	CIMT and any CRP gene polymorphism in either population. In white
	participants, the 1919T allele was associated with increased risk
	of stroke for TT vs AA (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40; 95\% confidence
	interval [CI], 1.06-1.87) and for CVD mortality (HR, 1.40; 95\% CI,
	1.10-1.90). In black participants, homozygosity for the 790T allele
	was associated with a 4-fold increased risk of MI compared with homozygosity
	for the 790A allele (95\% CI, 1.58-10.53). The minor alleles of the
	2 SNPs associated with lower plasma CRP concentration in white participants
	(2667C and 3872A) were associated with decreased risk of CVD mortality.
	CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation in the CRP gene is associated with
	plasma CRP levels and CVD risk in older adults.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: C-Reactive protein (CRP) gene variation has been associated
	with serum CRP levels in the general population. We examined the
	associations of CRP gene variation with longitudinal CRP measurements
	and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in a cohort of 504
	white and 244 African-American incident dialysis patients. METHODS:
	Seven tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CRP gene were
	selected by using the Carlson method (r(2) > 0.65). High-sensitivity
	CRP was measured every 6 months (mean, 4.6 months). Haplo.glm was
	used to determine the association of haplotypes with serum CRP levels
	and CVD risk. Global tests from Haplo.score were conducted to determine
	statistical significance. RESULTS: Compared with the most common
	haplotype, 1 haplotype was associated with a 52\% lower CRP level
	at baseline among African Americans (ratio, 0.48; 95\% confidence
	interval [CI], 0.28 to 0.82; global P-value = 0.0005). Furthermore,
	this haplotype was associated significantly with lower serum CRP
	levels during 36 months of follow-up. Among whites, this haplotype
	was associated with an 18\% (ratio, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.56 to 1.22;
	n = 6 carriers) lower CRP level compared with the most common haplotype
	with a frequency of 1\% (global P-value = 0.048). No association
	was detected between CRP gene variation and CVD risk in either whites
	or African Americans. CONCLUSION: Compared with the most common haplotype
	of the CRP gene, 1 haplotype predicts a lower serum CRP level over
	time, but no association exists between haplotype of CRP gene and
	incident CVD in this incident dialysis population. Serum CRP level
	might be a biomarker, rather than a causal factor, in CVD development.
	CRP variation may lead to susceptibility to inflammation, but not
	risk for CVD; however, replication in multiple settings is necessary.},
