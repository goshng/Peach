  abstract = {Despite the fundamental role of plant domestication in human history
	and the critical importance of a relatively small number of crop
	plants to modern societies, we still know little about adaptation
	under domestication. Here we focus on efforts to identify the genes
	responsible for adaptation to domestication. We start from a historical
	perspective, arguing that Darwin's conceptualization of domestication
	and unconscious selection provides valuable insight into the evolutionary
	history of crops and also provides a framework to evaluate modern
	methods used to decipher the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic
	change. We then review these methods, framing the discussion in terms
	of the phenotype-genotype hierarchy. Top-down approaches, such as
	quantitative trait locus and linkage disequilibrium mapping, start
	with a phenotype of interest and use genetic analysis to identify
	candidate genes. Bottom-up approaches, alternatively, use population
	genetic analyses to identify potentially adaptive genes and then
	rely on standard bioinformatics and reverse genetic tools to connect
	selected genes to a phenotype. We discuss the successes, advantages,
	and challenges of each, but we conclude that bottom-up approaches
	to understanding domestication as an adaptive process hold greater
	promise both for the study of adaptation and as a means to identify
	genes that contribute to agronomically important traits.},
