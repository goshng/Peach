	it is evident that the molecular clock does not hold in an exact
	sense, accounting for evolution of the rate of molecular evolution
	is a prerequisite when estimating divergence times with molecular
	sequences. Recently proposed statistical methods that account for
	this rate variation are overviewed and one of these procedures is
	applied to the mitochondrial protein sequences and to the nuclear
	gene sequences from many mammalian species in order to estimate the
	time scale of eutherian evolution. This Bayesian method not only
	takes account of the variation of molecular evolutionary rate among
	lineages and among genes, but it also incorporates fossil evidence
	via constraints on node times. With denser taxonomic sampling and
	a more realistic model of molecular evolution, this Bayesian approach
	is expected to increase the accuracy of divergence time estimates.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a number of phylogenetic methods have been developed
	for estimating molecular rates and divergence dates under models
	that relax the molecular clock constraint by allowing rate change
	throughout the tree. These methods are being used with increasing
	frequency, but there have been few studies into their accuracy. We
	tested the accuracy of several relaxed-clock methods (penalized likelihood
	and Bayesian inference using various models of rate change) using
	nucleotide sequences simulated on a nine-taxon tree. When the sequences
	evolved with a constant rate, the methods were able to infer rates
	accurately, but estimates were more precise when a molecular clock
	was assumed. When the sequences evolved under a model of auto-correlated
	rate change, rates were accurately estimated using penalized likelihood
	and by Bayesian inference using lognormal and exponential models
	of rate change, while other models did not perform as well. When
	the sequences evolved under a model of uncorrelated rate change,
	only Bayesian inference using an exponential rate model performed
	well. Collectively, the results provide a strong recommendation for
	using the exponential model of rate change if a conservative approach
	to divergence time estimation is required. A case study is presented
	in which we use a simulation-based approach to examine the hypothesis
	of elevated rates in the Cambrian period, and it is found that these
	high rate estimates might be an artifact of the rate estimation method.
	If this bias is present, then the ages of metazoan divergences would
	be systematically underestimated. The results of this study have
	implications for studies of molecular rates and divergence dates.},

	with the exact probability of the history determined from a system
	of recursions. Analysis of a subset of the data, for which recursive

	ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous rates is not designed to detect
	simultaneous increases or simultaneous decreases in synonymous and

	in the times at which sequences are sampled can have a profound effect
	both on the ability to detect trends over time in evolutionary rates
	and on the power to reject the Molecular Clock Hypothesis (MCH).
	Trends in viral evolutionary rates are of particular interest because
	their detection may allow connections to be established between a
	patient's treatment or condition and the process of evolution. Variation
	in sequence isolation times also impacts the uncertainty associated
	with estimates of divergence times and evolutionary rates. Variation
	in isolation times can be intentionally adjusted to increase the
	power of hypothesis tests and to reduce the uncertainty of evolutionary
	parameter estimates, but this fact has received little previous attention.
	RESULTS: We provide approximations for the power to reject the MCH
	when the alternative is that rates change in a linear fashion over
	time and when the alternative is that rates differ randomly among
	branches. In addition, we approximate the standard deviation of estimated
	evolutionary rates and divergence times. We illustrate how these
	approximations can be exploited to determine which viral sample to
	sequence when samples representing different dates are available.},

  abstract = {The insect order Diptera, the true flies, contains one of the four
	largest Mesozoic insect radiations within its suborder Brachycera.
	Estimates of phylogenetic relationships and divergence dates among
	the major brachyceran lineages have been problematic or vague because
	of a lack of consistent evidence and the rarity of well-preserved
	fossils. Here, we combine new evidence from nucleotide sequence data,
	morphological reinterpretations, and fossils to improve estimates
	of brachyceran evolutionary relationships and ages. The 28S ribosomal
	DNA (rDNA) gene was sequenced for a broad diversity of taxa, and
	the data were combined with recently published morphological scorings
	for a parsimony-based phylogenetic analysis. The phylogenetic topology
	inferred from the combined 28S rDNA and morphology data set supports
	brachyceran monophyly and the monophyly of the four major brachyceran
	infraorders and suggests relationships largely consistent with previous
	classifications. Weak support was found for a basal brachyceran clade
	comprising the infraorders Stratiomyomorpha (soldier flies and relatives),
	Xylophagomorpha (xylophagid flies), and Tabanomorpha (horse flies,
	snipe flies, and relatives). This topology and similar alternative
	arrangements were used to obtain Bayesian estimates of divergence
	times, both with and without the assumption of a constant evolutionary
	rate. The estimated times were relatively robust to the choice of
	prior distributions. Divergence times based on the 28S rDNA and several
	fossil constraints indicate that the Brachycera originated in the
	late Triassic or earliest Mesozoic and that all major lower brachyceran
	fly lineages had near contemporaneous origins in the mid-Jurassic
	prior to the origin of flowering plants (angiosperms). This study
	provides increased resolution of brachyceran phylogeny, and our revised
	estimates of fly ages should improve the temporal context of evolutionary
	inferences and genomic comparisons between fly model organisms.},

  abstract = {Divergence time and substitution rate are seriously confounded in
	phylogenetic analysis, making it difficult to estimate divergence
	times when the molecular clock (rate constancy among lineages) is
	violated. This problem can be alleviated to some extent by analyzing
	multiple gene loci simultaneously and by using multiple calibration
	points. While different genes may have different patterns of evolutionary
	rate change, they share the same divergence times. Indeed, the fact
	that each gene may violate the molecular clock differently leads
	to the advantage of simultaneous analysis of multiple loci. Multiple
	calibration points provide the means for characterizing the local
	evolutionary rates on the phylogeny. In this paper, we extend previous
	likelihood models of local molecular clock for estimating species
	divergence times to accommodate multiple calibration points and multiple
	genes. Heterogeneity among different genes in evolutionary rate and
	in substitution process is accounted for by the models. We apply
	the likelihood models to analyze two mitochondrial protein-coding
	genes, cytochrome oxidase II and cytochrome b, to estimate divergence
	times of Malagasy mouse lemurs and related outgroups. The likelihood
	method is compared with the Bayes method of Thorne et al. (1998,
	Mol. Biol. Evol. 15:1647-1657), which uses a probabilistic model
	to describe the change in evolutionary rate over time and uses the
	Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure to derive the posterior distribution
	of rates and times. Our likelihood implementation has the drawbacks
	of failing to accommodate uncertainties in fossil calibrations and
	of requiring the researcher to classify branches on the tree into
	different rate groups. Both problems are avoided in the Bayes method.
	Despite the differences in the two methods, however, data partitions
	and model assumptions had the greatest impact on date estimation.
	The three codon positions have very different substitution rates
	and evolutionary dynamics, and assumptions in the substitution model
	affect date estimation in both likelihood and Bayes analyses. The
	results demonstrate that the separate analysis is unreliable, with
	dates variable among codon positions and between methods, and that
	the combined analysis is much more reliable. When the three codon
	positions were analyzed simultaneously under the most realistic models
	using all available calibration information, the two methods produced
	similar results. The divergence of the mouse lemurs is dated to be
	around 7-10 million years ago, indicating a surprisingly early species
	radiation for such a morphologically uniform group of primates.},
