  abstract = {{The full repertoire of hepatitis B virus (HBV) peptides that bind
	to the common HLA class I molecules found in areas with a high prevalence
	of chronic HBV infection has not been determined. This information
	may be useful for designing immunotherapies for chronic hepatitis
	B. We identified amino acid residues under positive selection pressure
	in the HBV core gene by phylogenetic analysis of cloned DNA sequences
	obtained from HBV DNA extracted from the sera of Tongan subjects
	with inactive, HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infections. The repertoires
	of positively selected sites in groups of subjects who were homozygous
	for either HLA-B{*}4001 (n = 10) or HLA-B{*}5602 (n = 7) were compared.
	We identified 13 amino acid sites under positive selection pressure.
	A significant association between an HLA class I allele and the presence
	of nonsynonymous mutations was found at five of these sites. HLA-B{*}4001
	was associated with mutations at E77 (P = 0.05) and E113 (P = 0.002),
	and HLA-B{*}5602 was associated with mutations at S21 (P = 0.02).
	In addition, amino acid mutations at V13 (P = 0.03) and E14 (P =
	0.01) were more common in the seven subjects with an HLA-A{*}02 allele.
	In summary, we have developed an assay that can identify associations
	between HLA class I alleles and HBV core gene amino acids that mutate
	in response to selection pressure. This is consistent with published
	evidence that CD8(+) T cells have a role in suppressing viral replication
	in inactive, HBeAg-negative chronic HBV infection. This assay may
	be useful for identifying the clinically significant HBV peptides
	that bind to common HLA class I molecules.}},

	We examined how pathogen selection has driven the diversification
	and coevolution of IgA and Fc alpha RI. In higher primates, the IgA
	binding site of Fc alpha RI diversified under positive selection,
	a strong episode occurring in hominoid ancestors about the time of
	the IgA gene duplication. The differential binding of SSL7 to IgA-Fc
	of different species correlates with substitution at seven positions
	in IgA-Fc, two of which were positively selected in higher primates.
	Two others, which reduce SSL7 binding, emerged during episodes of
	positive selection in the rabbit and rodent lineages. The Fc alpha
	RI-IgA interaction evolves episodically under two types of positive
	selection: pressure from pathogen decoys selects for IgA escape variants
	which, in turn, selects for Fc alpha RI variants to keep up with
	the novel IgA. When Fc alpha RI cannot keep up, its function is lost
	and the gene becomes susceptible to elimination, as occurred in the

  abstract = {{Background: In comparative analyses of bacterial pathogens, it has
	been common practice to discriminate between two types of genes:
	(i) those shared by pathogens and their non-pathogenic relatives
	(core genes), and (ii) those found exclusively in pathogens (pathogen-specific
	accessory genes). Rather than attempting to a priori delineate genes
	into sets more or less relevant to pathogenicity, we took a broad
	approach to the analysis of Streptococcus species by investigating
	the strength of natural selection in all clusters of homologous genes.
	The genus Streptococcus is comprised of a wide variety of both pathogenic
	and commensal lineages, and we relate our findings to the pre-existing
	knowledge of Streptococcus virulence factors. Results: Our analysis
	of 1730 gene clusters revealed 136 cases of positive Darwinian selection,
	which we suggest is most likely to result from an antagonistic interaction
	between the host and pathogen at the molecular level. A two-step
	validation procedure suggests that positive selection was robustly
	identified in our genomic survey. We found no evidence to support
	the notion that pathogen specific accessory genes are more likely
	to be subject to positive selection than core genes. Indeed, we even
	uncovered a few cases of essential gene evolution by positive selection.
	Among the gene clusters subject to positive selection, a large fraction
	(29\%) can be connected to virulence. The most striking finding was
	that a considerable fraction of the positively selected genes are
	also known to have tissue specific patterns of expression during
	invasive disease. As current expression data is far from comprehensive,
	we suggest that this fraction was underestimated. Conclusion: Our
	findings suggest that pathogen specific genes, although a popular
	focus of research, do not provide a complete picture of the evolutionary
	dynamics of virulence. The results of this study, and others, support
	the notion that the products of both core and accessory genes participate
	in complex networks that comprise the molecular basis of virulence.
	Future work should seek to understand the evolutionary dynamics of
	both core and accessory genes as a function of the networks in which
	they participate.}},

	a means to detect short episodes of molecular adaptation affecting

	the branches to be tested for positive selection have to be specified
	a priori. In the absence of a biological hypothesis to designate
	so-called foreground branches, one may test many branches, but a
	correction for multiple testing becomes necessary. In this paper,
	we employ computer simulation to evaluate the performance of 6 multiple
	test correction procedures when the branch-site models are used to
	test every branch on the phylogeny for positive selection. Four of
	the methods control the familywise error rates (FWERs), whereas the

	correction procedures achieved acceptable FWER except for extremely
	divergent sequences and serious model violations, when the test may
	become unreliable. The power of the test to detect positive selection
	is influenced by the strength of selection and the sequence divergence,

	4 correction procedures that control the FWER had similar power.
	We recommend Rom's procedure for its slightly higher power, but the

  abstract = {{Background. Because rates of evolution and species divergence times
	cannot be estimated directly from molecular data, all current dating
	methods require that specific assumptions be made before inferring

	of molecular evolution (molecular clock hypothesis, local clocks
	models) or on both rates and times (penalized likelihood, Bayesian
	methods). However, most of these assumptions can affect estimated
	dates, oftentimes because they underestimate large amounts of rate
	change. Principal Findings. A significant modification to a recently
	proposed ad hoc rate-smoothing algorithm is described, in which local
	molecular clocks are automatically placed on a phylogeny. This modification
	makes use of hybrid approaches that borrow from recent theoretical
	developments in microarray data analysis. An ad hoc integration of
	phylogenetic uncertainty under these local clock models is also described.
	The performance and accuracy of the new methods are evaluated by
	reanalyzing three published data sets. Conclusions. It is shown that
	the new maximum likelihood hybrid methods can perform better than

  abstract = {{Background: Due to its high polymorphism and importance for disease
	resistance, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been an
	important focus of many vertebrate genome projects. Avian MHC organization
	is of particular interest because the chicken Gallus gallus, the
	avian species with the best characterized MHC, possesses a highly
	streamlined minimal essential MHC, which is linked to resistance
	against specific pathogens. It remains unclear the extent to which
	this organization describes the situation in other birds and whether
	it represents a derived or ancestral condition. The sequencing of
	the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata genome, in combination with targeted
	bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequencing, has allowed us
	to characterize an MHC from a highly divergent and diverse avian
	lineage, the passerines. Results: The zebra finch MHC exhibits a
	complex structure and history involving gene duplication and fragmentation.
	The zebra finch MHC includes multiple Class I and Class II genes,
	some of which appear to be pseudogenes, and spans a much more extensive
	genomic region than the chicken MHC, as evidenced by the presence
	of MHC genes on each of seven BACs spanning 739 kb. Cytogenetic (FISH)
	evidence and the genome assembly itself place core MHC genes on as
	many as four chromosomes with TAP and Class I genes mapping to different
	chromosomes. MHC Class II regions are further characterized by high
	endogenous retroviral content. Lastly, we find strong evidence of
	selection acting on sites within passerine MHC Class I and Class
	II genes. Conclusion: The zebra finch MHC differs markedly from that
	of the chicken, the only other bird species with a complete genome
	sequence. The apparent lack of synteny between TAP and the expressed
	MHC Class I locus is in fact reminiscent of a pattern seen in some
	mammalian lineages and may represent convergent evolution. Our analyses
	of the zebra finch MHC suggest a complex history involving chromosomal
	fission, gene duplication and translocation in the history of the
	MHC in birds, and highlight striking differences in MHC structure

	Codon models that specify data partitions as fixed effects allow

	partitions are a priori identifiable. Models that use a parametric
	distribution to express the variability in the omega ratio across
	site do not require a priori partitioning of sites, but they permit
	less among-site diversity in the evolutionary process. Simulation
	studies presented in this paper indicate that differences among sites

	can reflect more than just natural selection pressure. We also find
	that the classic likelihood ratio tests for positive selection have
	a high false-positive rate in some situations. In this paper, we
	developed a new method for assigning codon sites into groups where
	each group has a different model, and the likelihood over all sites
	is maximized. The method, called likelihood-based clustering (LiBaC),
	can be viewed as a generalization of the family of model-based clustering
	approaches to models of codon evolution. We report the performance
	of several LiBaC-based methods, and selected alternative methods,

	model, can provide reliable parameter estimates when the process
	of evolution is very heterogeneous among groups of sites. Certain
	types of proteins, such as transmembrane proteins, are expected to
	exhibit such heterogeneity. A survey of genes encoding transmembrane

  abstract = {{Background: Adaptive evolution appears to be a common feature of
	reproductive proteins across a very wide range of organisms. A promising
	way of addressing the evolutionary forces responsible for this general
	phenomenon is to test for adaptive evolution in the same gene but
	among groups of species, which differ in their reproductive biology.
	One can then test evolutionary hypotheses by asking whether the variation
	in adaptive evolution is consistent with the variation in reproductive
	biology. We have attempted to apply this approach to the study of
	a female reproductive protein, zona pellucida C ( ZPC), which has
	been previously shown by the use of likelihood ratio tests (LRTs)
	to be under positive selection in mammals. Results: We tested for
	evidence of adaptive evolution of ZPC in 15 mammalian species, in
	11 avian species and in six fish species using three different LRTs
	(M1a-M2a, M7-M8, and M8a-M8). The only significant findings of adaptive
	evolution came from the M7-M8 test in mammals and fishes. Since LRTs
	of adaptive evolution may yield false positives in some situations,
	we examined the properties of the LRTs by several different simulation
	methods. When we simulated data to test the robustness of the LRTs,
	we found that the pattern of evolution in ZPC generates an excess
	of false positives for the M7-M8 LRT but not for the M1a-M2a or M8a-M8
	LRTs. This bias is strong enough to have generated the significant
	M7-M8 results for mammals and fishes. Conclusion: We conclude that
	there is no strong evidence for adaptive evolution of ZPC in any
	of the vertebrate groups we studied, and that the M7-M8 LRT can be
	biased towards false inference of adaptive evolution by certain patterns
	of non-adaptive evolution.}},

	carboxylase (PEPC), a key enzyme of the C-4 pathway, evolved through
	numerous independent but convergent genetic changes in grasses (Poaceae).
	To compare the genetics of multiple C-4 origins on a broader scale,
	we reconstructed the evolutionary history of the C-4 pathway in sedges
	(Cyperaceae), the second most species-rich C-4 family. A sedge phylogeny
	based on two plastome genes (rbcL and ndhF) has previously identified
	six fully C-4 clades. Here, a relaxed molecular clock was used to
	calibrate this tree and showed that the first C-4 acquisition occurred
	in this family between 19.6 and 10.1 Ma. According to analyses of
	PEPC-encoding genes (ppc), at least five distinct C-4 origins are
	present in sedges. Two C-4 Eleocharis species, which were unrelated
	in the plastid phylogeny, acquired their C-4-specific PEPC genes
	from a single source, probably through reticulate evolution or a
	horizontal transfer event. Acquisitions of C-4 PEPC in sedges have
	been driven by positive selection on at least 16 codons (3.5\% of
	the studied gene segment). These sites underwent parallel genetic
	changes across the five sedge C-4 origins. Five of these sites underwent
	identical changes also in grass and eudicot C-4 lineages, indicating
	that genetic convergence is most important within families but that
	identical genetic changes occurred even among distantly related taxa.

	forces involved in sexual selection. One of the most often suggested
	of these forces is sexual conflict involving sperm competition and
	polyspermy avoidance. Bird species offer a unique opportunity to
	test this hypothesis since the avian egg coat tolerates physiological
	polyspermy, or the penetration of multiple sperm during fertilization,
	without negative effects on later development. Despite this, and
	the extensive amount of data gathered on sexual selection in birds,

	proteins. Here we present an analysis of the pattern of evolution
	of Zona Pellucida 3 (ZP3), a protein present on the avian egg coat.
	We found that, across several galliform and a single anseriform species,

  abstract = {{Background: The Recombination Activating Proteins, RAG1 and RAG2,
	play a crucial role in the immune response in vertebrates. Among
	the nuclear markers currently used for phylogenetic purposes, Rag1
	has especially enjoyed enormous popularity, since it successfully
	contributed to elucidating the relationships among and within a large
	variety of vertebrate lineages. We here report on a comparative investigation
	of the genetic variation, base composition, presence of indels, and
	selection in Rag1 in different vertebrate lineages (Actinopterygii,
	Amphibia, Aves, Chondrichthyes, Crocodylia, Lepidosauria, Mammalia,
	and Testudines) through the analysis of 582 sequences obtained from
	Genbank. We also analyze possible differences between distinct parts
	of the gene with different type of protein functions. Results: In
	the vertebrate lineages studied, Rag1 is over 3 kb long. We observed
	a high level of heterogeneity in base composition at the 3(rd) codon
	position in some of the studied vertebrate lineages and in some specific
	taxa. This result is also paralleled by taxonomic differences in
	the GC content at the same codon position. Moreover, positive selection
	occurs at some sites in Aves, Lepidosauria and Testudines. Indels,
	which are often used as phylogenetic characters, are more informative
	across vertebrates in the 5' than in the 3'-end of the gene. When
	the entire gene is considered, the use of indels as phylogenetic
	character only recovers one major vertebrate clade, the Actinopterygii.
	However, in numerous cases insertions or deletions are specific to
	a monophyletic group. Conclusions: Rag1 is a phylogenetic marker
	of undoubted quality. Our study points to the need of carrying out
	a preliminary investigation on the base composition and the possible
	existence of sites under selection of this gene within the groups
	studied to avoid misleading resolution. The gene shows highly heterogeneous
	base composition, which affects some taxa in particular and contains
	sites under positive selection in some vertebrate lineages in the
	5'-end. The first part of the gene (5'-end) is more variable than
	the second (3'-end), and less affected by a heterogeneous base composition.
	However, in some vertebrate lineages the 5'-end of the gene is not

	Eight rbcL codons evolving under positive selection in C-4 clades

	Results: We sequenced a region of 3610 nucleotides (encoding a 392
	amino acid-long region of the NORK protein) in 32 Medicago species.
	We confirm that positive selection in NORK has occurred within the

	Only one branch out of five tested, leading to M. noeana, displays

	of rhizobial specificity. Conclusion: Adaptive changes in the sequence
	of the NORK receptor have involved the LRRs, but targeted different
	sites than in most previous studies of LRR proteins evolution. The
	fact that positive selection in NORK tends not to be associated to
	changes in rhizobial specificity indicates that this gene was probably

	elucidating the mechanisms of adaptive evolutionary change leading

	process involving gene duplication is neo-functionalization (NEO-F),
	in which one copy undergoes directional selection to perform a novel

	After duplication, one copy is free to improve novel function, whereas

  abstract = {{Background: PSA (promastigote surface antigen) is one of the major
	classes of membrane proteins present at the surface of the parasitic
	protozoan Leishmania. While it harbours leucine rich repeats, which
	are suggestive of its involvement in parasite-to-host physical interactions,
	its exact role is largely unknown. Furthermore, the extent of diversity
	of this gene family, both in copy number and sequence has not been
	established. Results: From the newly available complete genome sequences
	of L. major, L. infantum and L. braziliensis, we have established
	the complete list of PSA genes, based on the conservation of specific
	domain architecture. The latter includes an array of leucine rich
	repeats of unique signature flanked by conserved cysteine-rich domains.
	All PSA genes code either for secreted or membrane-anchored surface
	proteins. Besides the few previously identified PSA genes, which
	are shown here to be part of a relatively large subclass of PSA genes
	located on chromosome 12, this study identifies seven other PSA subtypes.
	The latter, whose genes lie on chromosomes 5, 9, 21 and 31 in all
	three species, form single gene ( two genes in one instance) subfamilies,
	which phylogenetically cluster as highly related orthologs. On the
	other hand, genes found on chromosome 12 generally show high diversification,
	as reflected in greater sequence divergence between species, and
	in an extended set of divergent paralogs. Moreover, we show that
	the latter genes are submitted to strong positive selection. We also
	provide evidence that evolution of these genes is driven by intra-
	and intergenic recombination, thereby modulating the number of LRRs
	in protein and generating chimeric genes. Conclusion: PSA is a Leishmania
	family of membrane-bound or secreted proteins, whose main signature
	consists in a specific LRR sequence. All PSA genes found in the genomes
	of three sequenced Leishmania species unambiguously distribute into
	eight subfamilies of orthologs. Seven of these are evolving relatively
	slowly and could correspond to basic functions related to parasite/host
	interactions. On the opposite, the other PSA gene class, which include
	all so far experimentally studied PSA genes, could be involved in

  abstract = {{The process of fertilization is critically dependent on the mutual
	recognition of gametes and in Plasmodium, the male gamete surface
	protein P48/45 is vital to this process. This protein belongs to
	a family of 10 structurally related proteins, the so called 6-cys
	family. To identify the role of additional members of this family
	in Plasmodium fertilisation, we performed genetic and functional
	analysis on the five members of the 6-cys family that are transcribed
	during the gametocyte stage of P. berghei. This analysis revealed
	that in addition to P48/45, two members (P230 and P47) also play
	an essential role in the process of parasite fertilization. Mating
	studies between parasites lacking P230, P48/45 or P47 demonstrate
	that P230, like P48/45, is a male fertility factor, consistent with
	the previous demonstration of a protein complex containing both P48/45
	and P230. In contrast, disruption of P47 results in a strong reduction
	of female fertility, while males remain unaffected. Further analysis
	revealed that gametes of mutants lacking expression of p48/45 or
	p230 or p47 are unable to either recognise or attach to each other.
	Disruption of the paralog of p230, p230p, also specifically expressed
	in gametocytes, had no observable effect on fertilization. These
	results indicate that the P. berghei 6-cys family contains a number
	of proteins that are either male or female specific ligands that
	play an important role in gamete recognition and/or attachment. The
	implications of low levels of fertilisation that exist even in the
	absence of these proteins, indicating alternative pathways of fertilisation,
	as well as positive selection acting on these proteins, are discussed
	in the context of targeting these proteins as transmission blocking
	vaccine candidates.}},

	subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a secreted enzyme of the serine
	protease family that reduces cellular uptake of plasma low-density
	lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by promoting LDL receptor (LDL-R) degradation.
	Species-specific positive selection has been noted in the LDLR promoter,
	leading to differential expression of LDLR among primates. Whether
	PCSK9 experienced significant selective pressure to maintain a functional
	relationship with its target protein, LDL-R, is unknown. Methodology/Principal
	Findings. We compiled the sequences of the coding regions of PCSK9
	from 14 primate species in the clade of Hominoids, Old World monkeys
	and New World monkeys. To detect selective pressure at the protein
	level, the ratios of nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate (d(N)/d(S))
	under different evolutionary models were calculated across the phylogeny
	of PCSK9. Maximum likelihood analyses of d(N)/d(S) ratios for the
	aligned coding region sequences among 14 primate species indicated
	that PCSK9 was subject to a strong functional constraint (i.e., purifying
	selection). However, positive selection was noted in the functional
	carboxyl-terminal (C-terminal) domain in many branches across the
	phylogeny, especially in the lineage leading to the orangutan. Furthermore,
	at least five positively selected amino acids were detected in this
	lineage using the branch-site model A. In a sliding-window analysis,
	several d(N)/d(S) peaks in the C-terminal domain in both the human

	shaped evolutionary patterns in the functional domains of PCSK9,

	analysis of chicken (Gallus gallus) and zebra finch (Taeniopygia

	alpha ), a key cytokine receptor as a candidate with a significant

  abstract = {{Background: The Picornaviridae family contains a number of important
	pathogenic viruses, among which the recently reclassified human parechoviruses
	(HPeVs). These viruses are widespread and can be grouped in several
	types. Understanding the evolutionary history of HPeV could answer
	questions such as how long the circulating lineages last shared a
	common ancestor and how the evolution of this viral species is shaped
	by its population dynamics. Using both strict and relaxed clock Bayesian
	phylogenetics we investigated 1) the substitutions rates of the structural
	P1 and capsid VP1 regions and 2) evolutionary timescale of currently
	circulating HPeV lineages. Results: Our estimates reveal that human
	parechoviruses exhibit high substitution rates for both structural
	P1 and capsid VP1 regions, respectively 2.21 x 10(-3) (0.48 - 4.21
	x 10(-3)) and 2.79 x 10(-3) (2.05 - 3.66 x 10(-3)) substitutions

	picornaviruses. By employing a constant population size coalescent
	prior, the date of the most recent common ancestor was estimated

	The evolution of forkhead genes has not been widely examined and
	selection pressures at the molecular level influencing subfamily
	evolution and differentiation have not been explored. Here, in silico
	pressures acting on the coding sequence of five multi-species FOX
	protein subfamily clusters; FoxA, FoxD, FoxI, FoxO and FoxP. Results:
	Application of site models, which estimate overall selection pressures
	on individual codons throughout the phylogeny, showed that the amino
	acid changes observed were either neutral or under negative selection.
	Branch-site models, which allow estimated selection pressures along
	specified lineages to vary as compared to the remaining phylogeny,
	identified positive selection along branches leading to the FoxA3
	and Protostomia clades in the FoxA cluster and the branch leading
	to the FoxO3 clade in the FoxO cluster. Residues that may differentiate
	paralogs were identified in the FoxA and FoxO clusters and residues
	that differentiate orthologs were identified in the FoxA cluster.
	Neutral amino acid changes were identified in the forkhead domain
	of the FoxA, FoxD and FoxP clusters while positive selection was
	identified in the forkhead domain of the Protostomia lineage of the
	FoxA cluster. A series of residues under strong negative selection
	adjacent to the N- and C-termini of the forkhead domain were identified
	in all clusters analyzed suggesting a new method for refinement of
	domain boundaries. Extrapolation of domains among cluster members
	in conjunction with selection pressure information allowed prediction
	of residue function in the FoxA, FoxO and FoxP clusters and exclusion
	of known domain function in residues of the FoxA and FoxI clusters.
	Conclusion: Consideration of selection pressures observed in conjunction
	with known functional information allowed prediction of residue function
	and refinement of domain boundaries. Identification of residues that
	differentiate orthologs and paralogs provided insight into the development

  abstract = {{Background: ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), which catalyses
	a rate limiting step in starch synthesis, is a heterotetramer comprised
	of two identical large and two identical small subunits in plants.
	Although the large and small subunits are equally sensitive to activity-altering
	amino acid changes when expressed in a bacterial system, the overall
	rate of non-synonymous evolution is similar to 2.7-fold greater for
	the large subunit than for the small subunit. Herein, we examine
	the basis for their different rates of evolution, the number of duplications
	in both large and small subunit genes and document changes in the
	patterns of AGPase evolution over time. Results: We found that the
	first duplication in the AGPase large subunit family occurred early
	in the history of land plants, while the earliest small subunit duplication
	occurred after the divergence of monocots and eudicots. The large
	subunit also had a larger number of gene duplications than did the
	small subunit. The ancient duplications in the large subunit family
	raise concern about the saturation of synonymous substitutions, but
	estimates of the absolute rate of AGPase evolution were highly correlated
	with estimates of. (the non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio).
	Both subunits showed evidence for positive selection and relaxation
	of purifying selection after duplication, but these phenomena could
	not explain the different evolutionary rates of the two subunits.
	Instead, evolutionary constraints appear to be permanently relaxed
	for the large subunit relative to the small subunit. Both subunits
	exhibit branch-specific patterns of rate variation among sites. Conclusion:
	These analyses indicate that the higher evolutionary rate of the
	plant AGPase large subunit reflects permanent relaxation of constraints
	relative to the small subunit and they show that the large subunit
	genes have undergone more gene duplications than small subunit genes.
	Candidate sites potentially responsible for functional divergence
	within each of the AGPase subunits were investigated by examining
	branch-specific patterns of rate variation. We discuss the phenotypes

	little is known about its diversity or physiology in teleosts, an
	infraclass of the bony fishes comprising similar to 50\% of all extant

	by searching genomic and cDNA databases from eight teleost species;
	phylogenetic, molecular evolutionary, and syntenic data analyses
	were conducted to understand the relationship and differential patterns
	of evolution of relaxin family genes in teleosts compared with mammals.
	Additionally, real-time quantitative PCR was used to confirm and
	assess the tissues of expression of five relaxin family genes in
	Danio rerio and in situ hybridization used to assess the site-specific
	expression of the insulin 3-like gene in D. rerio testis. Results:
	Up to six relaxin family genes were identified in each teleost species.
	Comparative syntenic mapping revealed that fish possess two paralogous
	copies of human RLN3, which we call rln3a and rln3b, an orthologue
	of human RLN2, rln, two paralogous copies of human INSL5, insl5a
	and insl5b, and an orthologue of human INSL3, insl3. Molecular evolutionary
	analyses indicated that: rln3a, rln3b and rln are under strong evolutionary
	constraint, that insl3 has been subject to moderate rates of sequence
	evolution with two amino acids in insl3/INSL3 showing evidence of
	positively selection, and that insl5b exhibits a higher rate of sequence
	evolution than its paralogue insl5a suggesting that it may have been
	neo-functionalized after the teleost whole genome duplication. Quantitative
	PCR analyses in D. rerio indicated that rln3a and rln3b are expressed
	in brain, insl3 is highly expressed in gonads, and that there was
	low expression of both insl5 genes in adult zebrafish. Finally, in
	situ hybridization of insl3 in D. rerio testes showed highly specific
	hybridization to interstitial Leydig cells. Conclusions: Contrary
	to previous studies, we find convincing evidence that teleosts contain
	orthologues of four relaxin family peptides. Overall our analyses
	suggest that in teleosts: 1) rln3 exhibits a similar evolution and
	expression pattern to mammalian RLN3, 2) insl3 has been subject to
	positive selection like its mammalian counterpart and shows similar
	tissue-specific expression in Leydig cells, 3) insl5 genes are highly
	represented and have a relatively high rate of sequence evolution
	in teleost genomes, but they exhibited only low levels of expression
	in adult zebrafish, 4) rln is evolving under very different selective

	majority of small ruminant isolates are represented by a single,
	widespread clonal complex (CC133) of S. aureus, but its evolutionary
	origin and the molecular basis for its host tropism remain unknown.

	of a human to ruminant host jump followed by adaptive genome diversification.
	Comparative whole-genome sequencing revealed molecular evidence for
	host adaptation including gene decay and diversification of proteins
	involved in host-pathogen interactions. Importantly, several novel
	mobile genetic elements encoding virulence proteins with attenuated
	or enhanced activity in ruminants were widely distributed in CC133
	isolates, suggesting a key role in its host-specific interactions.

  abstract = {{Background: The destructive plant disease potato late blight is caused
	by the oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary.
	This disease has remained particularly problematic despite intensive
	breeding efforts to integrate resistance into cultivated potato,
	largely because of the pathogen's ability to quickly evolve to overcome
	major resistance genes. The RB gene, identified in the wild potato
	species S. bulbocastanum, encodes a protein that confers broad-spectrum
	resistance to most P. infestans isolates through its recognition
	of highly conserved members of the corresponding pathogen effector
	family IPI-O. IpiO is a multigene family of effectors and while the
	majority of IPI-O proteins are recognized by RB to elicit host resistance,
	some variants exist that are able to elude detection (e. g. IPI-O4).
	Methods and Findings: In the present study, analysis of ipiO variants
	among 40 different P. infestans isolates collected from Guatemala,
	Thailand, and the United States revealed a high degree of complexity
	within this gene family. Isolate aggressiveness was correlated with
	increased ipiO diversity and especially the presence of the ipiO4
	variant. Furthermore, isolates expressing IPI-O4 overcame RB-mediated
	resistance in transgenic potato plants even when the resistance-eliciting
	IPI-O1 variant was present. In support of this finding, we observed
	that expression of IPI-O4 via Agrobacterium blocked recognition of
	IPI-O1, leading to inactivation of RB-mediated programmed cell death
	in Nicotiana benthamiana. Conclusions: In this study we definitively
	demonstrate and provide the first evidence that P. infestans can
	defeat an R protein through inhibition of recognition of the corresponding
	effector protein.}},

	In a survey of 244 Oculina alleles, we find high nonsynonymous variation

  abstract = {{Background: In primates, infection is an important force driving
	gene evolution, and this is reflected in the importance of infectious
	disease in human morbidity today. The beta-defensins are key components
	of the innate immune system, with antimicrobial and cell signalling
	roles, but also reproductive functions. Here we examine evolution
	of beta-defensins in catarrhine primates and variation within different
	human populations. Results: We show that five beta-defensin genes
	that do not show copy number variation in humans show evidence of
	positive selection in catarrhine primates, and identify specific
	codons that have been under selective pressure. Direct haplotyping
	of DEFB127 in humans suggests long-term balancing selection: there
	are two highly diverged haplotype clades carrying different variants
	of a codon that, in primates, is positively selected. For DEFB132,
	we show that extensive diversity, including a four-state amino acid
	polymorphism (valine, isoleucine, alanine and threonine at position
	93), is present in hunter-gatherer populations, both African and
	non-African, but not found in samples from agricultural populations.
	Conclusion: Some, but not all, beta-defensin genes show positive
	selection in catarrhine primates. There is suggestive evidence of
	different selective pressures on these genes in humans, but the nature
	of the selective pressure remains unclear and is likely to differ

	the evolutionary pattern of Mx and positively selected sites which

	We used sequence comparisons among species to detect positively selected
	sites by conducting phylogenetic analysis. The two-ratio model was
	significantly better than the one-ratio model in four species (mouse,
	rat, chicken and duck, p < 0.05). Although selection pressure varied
	among different lineages, Mx had strong purifying selection in mammals
	and positive selection in chicken and duck lineages. Relative rate
	test revealed that Mx evolved faster in chickens than in ducks (Tajima's
	relative rate test, chi(2) =7.17,p < 0.01). In the further analysis
	using a branch-site model A test, 8 sites were positively selected

	lineage-specific positive selection acted on the Potamogeton rbcL.
	The contrasting ecological conditions between heterophyllous and

	function between the 2 paralogs (subfunctionalization {[}SF]). More
	recent studies propose that SF followed by NF (subneofunctionalization

	monosaccharide transporter (MST) gene families in Arabidopsis and
	rice. MSTs have an ancient origin, predating plants, and have evolved
	in the seed plant lineage to comprise 7 subfamilies. In Arabidopsis,
	53 putative MST genes have been identified, with one subfamily greatly
	expanded by tandem gene duplications. We searched the rice genome

	to mount a cell-autonomous defense against viral infections. Viral
	recognition determinants in intrinsic immunity genes are expected
	to evolve rapidly as host genes adapt to changing viruses, resulting
	in a signature of adaptive evolution. Zinc-finger antiviral protein
	( ZAP) from rats was discovered to be an intrinsic immunity gene
	that can restrict murine leukemia virus, and certain alphaviruses
	and filoviruses. Here, we used an approach combining molecular evolution
	and cellular infectivity assays to address whether ZAP also acts
	as a restriction factor in primates, and to pinpoint which protein
	domains may directly interact with the virus. We find that ZAP has
	evolved under positive selection throughout primate evolution. Recurrent
	positive selection is only found in the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
	(PARP)-like domain present in a longer human ZAP isoform. This PARP-like
	domain was not present in the previously identified and tested rat
	ZAP gene. Using infectivity assays, we found that the longer isoform
	of ZAP that contains the PARP-like domain is a stronger suppressor
	of murine leukemia virus expression and Semliki forest virus infection.
	Our study thus finds that human ZAP encodes a potent antiviral activity
	against alphaviruses. The striking congruence between our evolutionary
	predictions and cellular infectivity assays strongly validates such
	a combined approach to study intrinsic immunity genes.}},

	(PIM1) genes, the zebra finch genome appeared at first to additionally
	contain 67 PAK3-like (PAK3L) and 51 PIM1-like (PIM1L) protein kinase
	genes. An exhaustive analysis of these gene models, however, revealed
	most to be incomplete, owing to the absence of terminal exons. After
	reprediction, 31 PAK3L genes and 10 PIM1L genes remain, and all but
	three are predicted, from the retention of functional sites and open
	reading frames, to be enzymatically active. PAK3L, but not PIM1L,
	gene sequences show evidence of recurrent episodes of positive selection,
	concentrated within structures spatially adjacent to N- and C-terminal
	protein regions that have been discarded from zebra finch PAK3L genes.
	At least seven zebra finch PAK3L genes were observed to be expressed

	We investigated esterase B as a marker of phylogeny and/or virulence,
	in a thorough analysis of the esterase B-encoding gene. Results:
	We identified the gene encoding esterase B as the acetyl-esterase
	gene (aes) using gene disruption. The analysis of aes nucleotide
	sequences in a panel of 78 reference strains, including the E. coli
	reference (ECOR) strains, demonstrated that the gene is under purifying
	selection. The phylogenetic tree reconstructed from aes sequences
	showed a strong correlation with the species phylogenetic history,
	based on multi-locus sequence typing using six housekeeping genes.
	The unambiguous distinction between variants B1 and B2 by electrophoresis
	was consistent with Aes amino-acid sequence analysis and protein
	modelling, which showed that substituted amino acids in the two esterase
	B variants occurred mostly at different sites on the protein surface.
	Studies in an experimental mouse model of septicaemia using mutant
	strains did not reveal a direct link between aes and extraintestinal
	virulence. Moreover, we did not find any genes in the chromosomal
	region of aes to be associated with virulence. Conclusion: Our findings
	suggest that aes does not play a direct role in the virulence of
	E. coli extraintestinal infection. However, this gene acts as a powerful
	marker of phylogeny, illustrating the extensive divergence of B2
	phylogenetic group strains from the rest of the species.}},

	The aim of this study was to test the relationship between evolutionary

	For this purpose, we studied the fungal lipase/feruloyl esterase
	A family, whose functional diversification makes it a very promising
	candidate. Results: The results suggested functional shift following
	a duplication event where neofunctionalisation of feruloyl esterase
	A had occurred with conservation of the ancestral lipase function.
	Evolutionary shift was detected using the branch-site model for testing
	positive selection on individual codons along specific lineages.
	Positively selected amino acids were detected. Furthermore, biological
	data obtained from site-directed mutagenesis experiments clearly
	demonstrated that certain amino acids under positive selection were
	involved in the functional shift. We reassessed evolutionary history
	in terms of environmental response, and hypothesized that environmental
	changes such as colonisation by terrestrial plants might have driven
	adaptation by functional diversification in Euascomycetes (Aspergilli),
	thus conferring a selective advantage on this group. Conclusion:

	of effective vaccine and antiviral prophylaxis against HRV has been
	hampered by the extensive antigenic diversity present among the nearly

	Although the structural capsid genes and nonstructural genes recovered

	Methodology/Principal Findings: Results of non-synonymous and synonymous
	substitution rates reveal that Tetherin as a whole experiences neutral
	evolution rather than pervasive positive selection throughout primate
	evolution, as well as in non-primate mammal evolution. Sliding-window
	analyses show that the regions of the primate Tetherin that interact

	generally focus on these regions, indicating that the main selective

	The branch-site model detected positive selection acting on the ancestral

  abstract = {{Background: Gene duplication has been a fundamental process in the
	evolution of eukaryotic genomes. After duplication one copy (or both)
	can undergo divergence in sequence, expression pattern, and function.
	Two divergent copies of the ribosomal protein S13 gene (rps13) of
	chloroplast origin are found in the nucleus of the rosids Arabidopsis,
	Gossypium, and Glycine. One encodes chloroplast-imported RPS13 (nucp
	rps13), while the other encodes mitochondria-imported RPS13 (numit
	rps13). The rps13 gene has been lost from mitochondrial DNA (mt rps13)
	of many rosids. Results: We studied sequence evolution of numit rps13
	in comparison with nucp rps13 in seven rosid genera. K-a/K-s analysis
	and likelihood ratio tests showed considerably higher K-a values
	and K-a/K-s ratios in numit rps13 than in nucp rps13, indicating
	increased amino acid sequence divergence in numit rps13. Two positively
	selected codons were detected in numit RPS13 in regions that are
	inferred to interact with the 16S rRNA. Several amino acids in numit
	RPS13 have changed from the one present in nucp RPS13 to the one
	present in mt RPS13, showing that numit rps13 is becoming more like
	mt rps13. Comparison of expression patterns and levels of numit rps13
	and nucp rps13 in Arabidopsis using microarray data indicated divergence
	in gene expression. We discovered that in addition to numit rps13,
	Malus (apple) contains a transcribed mt rps13 gene. To determine
	if partitioning of expression takes place between numit rps13 and
	mt rps13, expression of both copies and RNA editing of mt rps13 were
	examined by RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and sequencing from 14 different organ
	types plus seedlings subjected to five different abiotic stresses.
	Co-expression of numit rps13 and mt rps13 was observed in all the
	organs and various stress treatments. We determined that purifying
	selection is acting on both numit rps13 and mt rps13 in Malus. Conclusion:
	Our data provide evidence that numit rps13 genes in rosids have experienced
	adaptive sequence evolution and convergent evolution with mt rps13.
	Co-expression of numit rps13 and mt rps13 and purifying selection
	on both genes in Malus suggest that both are functional. The three
	organellar rps13 genes in rosids provide a distinctive case of gene
	duplication involving the co-evolution of the nuclear and cytoplasmic
	genomes.}},

	of gene structures and sequence evolution of 77 genes transferred
	to the nucleus in various angiosperms, including multiple transfers
	of 10 genes in different lineages. Many genes contain mitochondrial
	targeting presequences, and potentially 5' cis-regulatory elements,
	that were acquired from pre-existing nuclear genes for mitochondrial
	proteins to create chimeric gene structures. In eight separate cases,
	the presequence was acquired from either the hsp70 chaperonin gene
	or the hsp22 chaperonin gene. The most common location of introns
	is in the presequence, and the least common is in the region transferred
	from the mitochondrion. Several genes have an intron between the
	presequence and the core region, or an intron in the 5'UTR (untranslated
	region) or 3'UTR, suggesting presequence and/or regulatory element
	acquisition by exon shuffling. Both synonymous and nonsynonymous

	Preservation of duplicate genes is promoted by functional divergence

	examples have been limited to vertebrate genomes, including primates
	where the domesticated envelope is under purifying selection to assist
	placental function. Here, we show that in Drosophila genomes, a previously
	unannotated gene (CG4715, renamed Iris) was domesticated from a novel,
	active Kanga lineage of insect retroviruses at least 25 million years
	ago, and has since been maintained as a host gene that is expressed
	in all adult tissues. Iris and the envelope genes from Kanga retroviruses
	are homologous to those found in insect baculoviruses and gypsy and
	roo insect retroviruses. Two separate envelope domestications from
	the Kanga and roo retroviruses have taken place, in fruit fly and
	mosquito genomes, respectively. Whereas retroviral envelopes are
	proteolytically cleaved into the ligand-interaction and membrane-fusion
	domains, Iris appears to lack this cleavage site. In the takahashii/suzukii

	to give rise to two genes (Iris-A and Iris-B). Iris-B has significantly
	diverged from the Iris-A lineage, primarily because of the ``invention{''}

	usually assume that only the non-synonymous rates vary among sites

	ignores the possibility of selection forces acting at the DNA or

	alleviate the widespread assumption that positions evolve independently

	between adjacent non-synonymous rates while the other describes the
	dependency between adjacent synonymous rates. The presented model
	is applied to study the selection pressure across the HIV-1 genome.
	The new model better describes the evolution of all HIV-1 genes,

	So far, studies on model marsupials used in laboratory investigations
	indicated very little or even no variation in MHC class II genes.
	However, natural levels of diversity and selection are unknown in
	marsupials as studies on wild populations are virtually absent. We
	used two endemic South American mouse opossums, Gracilinanus microtarsus
	and Marmosops incanus, to investigate characteristic features of
	MHC selection. This study is the first investigation of MHC selection
	in free-ranging Neotropical marsupials. In addition, the evolutionary
	history of MHC lineages within the group of marsupials was examined.
	Results: G. microtarsus showed extensive levels of MHC diversity
	within and among individuals as 47 MHC-DAB alleles and high levels
	of sequence divergence were detected at a minimum of four loci. Positively
	selected codon sites were identified, of which most were congruent
	with human antigen binding sites. The diversity in M. incanus was
	rather low with only eight observed alleles at presumably two loci.
	However, these alleles also revealed high sequence divergence. Again,
	positive selection was identified on specific codon sites, all congruent

	microtarsus. In a phylogenetic comparison alleles of M. incanus interspersed
	widely within alleles of G. microtarsus with four alleles being present
	in both species. Conclusion: Our investigations revealed extensive
	MHC class II polymorphism in a natural marsupial population, contrary
	to previous assumptions. Furthermore, our study confirms for the

  abstract = {{Over 50 years ago, Baker (1955, 1967)suggested that self-compatible
	species were more likely than self-incompatible species to establish
	new populations on oceanic islands. His logic was straightforward
	and rested on the assumption that colonization was infrequent; thus,
	mate limitation favored the establishment of self-fertilizing individuals.
	In support of Baker's rule, many authors have documented high frequencies
	of self-compatibility on islands, and recent work has solidified
	the generality of Baker's ideas. The genus Lycium (Solanaceae) has
	ca. 80 species distributed worldwide, and phylogenetic studies suggest
	that Lycium originated in South America and dispersed to the Old
	World a single time. Previous analyses of the S-RNase gene, which
	controls the stylar component of self-incompatibility, have shown
	that gametophytically controlled self-incompatibility is ancestral
	within the genus, making Lycium a good model for investigating Baker's
	assertions concerning reproductive assurance following oceanic dispersal.
	Lycium is also useful for investigations of reproductive evolution,
	given that species vary both in sexual expression and the presence
	of self-incompatibility. A model for the evolution of gender dimorphism
	suggests that polyploidy breaks down self-incompatibility, leading
	to the evolution of gender dimorphism, which arises as an alternative
	outcrossing mechanism. There is a perfect association of dimorphic
	gender expression, polyploidy, and self-compatibility (vs. cosexuality,
	diploidy, and self-incompatibility) among North American Lycium.
	Although the association between ploidy level and gender expression
	also holds for African Lycium, to date no studies of mating systems
	have been initiated in Old World species. Here, using controlled
	pollinations, we document strong self-incompatibility in two cosexual,
	diploid species of African Lycium. Further, we sequence the S-RNase
	gene in 15 individuals from five cosexual, diploid species of African
	Lycium and recover 24 putative alleles. Genealogical analyses indicate
	reduced trans-generic diversity of S-RNases in the Old World compared
	to the New World. We suggest that genetic diversity at this locus
	was reduced as a result of a founder event, but, despite the bottleneck,
	self-incompatibility was maintained in the Old World. Maximum-likelihood
	analyses of codon substitution patterns indicate that positive Darwinian
	selection has been relatively strong in the Old World, suggesting
	the rediversification of S-RNases following a bottleneck. The present
	data thus provide a dramatic exception to Baker's rule, in addition
	to supporting a key assumption of the Miller and Venable (2000) model,
	namely that self-incompatibility is associated with diploidy and
	cosexuality.}},

	Results: We show that selective pressures on reproductive proteins

  abstract = {{Charles Darwin proposed that evolution occurs primarily by natural
	selection, but this view has been controversial from the beginning.
	Two of the major opposing views have been mutationism and neutralism.
	Early molecular studies suggested that most amino acid substitutions
	in proteins are neutral or nearly neutral and the functional change
	of proteins occurs by a few key amino acid substitutions. This suggestion
	generated an intense controversy over selectionism and neutralism.
	This controversy is partially caused by Kimura's definition of neutrality,
	which was too strict (vertical bar 2Ns vertical bar <= 1). If we
	define neutral mutations as the mutations that do not change the
	function of gene products appreciably, many controversies disappear
	because slightly deleterious and slightly advantageous mutations
	are engulfed by neutral mutations. The ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous
	nucleotide substitution to that of synonymous substitution is a useful
	quantity to study positive Darwinian selection operating at highly
	variable genetic loci, but it does not necessarily detect adaptively
	important codons. Previously, multigene families were thought to
	evolve following the model of concerted evolution, but new evidence
	indicates that most of them evolve by a birth-and-death process of
	duplicate genes. It is now clear that most phenotypic characters
	or genetic systems such as the adaptive immune system in vertebrates
	are controlled by the interaction of a number of multigene families,
	which are often evolutionarily related and are subject to birth-and-death
	evolution. Therefore, it is important to study the mechanisms of
	gene family interaction for understanding phenotypic evolution. Because
	gene duplication occurs more or less at random, phenotypic evolution
	contains some fortuitous elements, though the environmental factors
	also play an important role. The randomness of phenotypic evolution
	is qualitatively different from allele frequency changes by random
	genetic drift. However, there is some similarity between phenotypic
	and molecular evolution with respect to functional or environmental
	constraints and evolutionary rate. It appears that mutation (including
	gene duplication and other DNA changes) is the driving force of evolution
	at both the genic and the phenotypic levels.}},

  abstract = {{The human polyomavirus BK virus (BKV) is ubiquitous in humans, infecting
	children asymptomatically. BKV is the only primate polyomavirus that
	has subtypes (I-IV) distinguishable by immunological reactivity.
	Nucleotide (nt) variations in a major capsid protein (VP1) gene region
	(designated the epitope region), probably responsible for antigenic
	diversity, have been used to classify BKV isolates into subtypes.
	Here, with all the protein-encoding gene sequences, we attempted
	to elucidate the evolutionary relationships among 28 BKV isolates
	belonging to subtypes I, III, and IV (no isolate belonging to subtype
	II, a minor one, was included). First, using the GTR + Gamma + I
	model, maximum likelihood trees were reconstructed for individual
	viral genes as well as for concatenated viral genes. On the resultant
	trees, the 28 BKV isolates were consistently divided into three clades
	corresponding to subtypes I, III, and IV, although bootstrap probabilities
	are not always high. Then we used more sophisticated likelihood models,
	one of which takes account of codon structure, to elucidate the phylogenetic
	relationships among BKV subtypes, but the phylogeny of the deep branchings
	remained ambiguous. Furthermore, the possibility of positive selection
	in the evolution of BKV was examined using the nonsynonymous/synonymous
	rate ratio as a measure of selection. An analysis based on entire
	genes could not detect any strong evidence for positive selection,
	but that based on the epitope region identified a few sites potentially
	under positive selection (these sites were among those showing subtype
	linked polymorphisms).}},

  abstract = {{Background: Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common non-viral human
	sexually transmitted pathogen and importantly, contributes to facilitating
	the spread of HIV. Yet very little is known about its surface and
	secreted proteins mediating interactions with, and permitting the
	invasion and colonisation of, the host mucosa. Initial annotations
	of T. vaginalis genome identified a plethora of candidate extracellular
	proteins. Results: Data mining of the T. vaginalis genome identified
	911 BspA-like entries (TvBspA) sharing TpLRR-like leucine-rich repeats,
	which represent the largest gene family encoding potential extracellular
	proteins for the pathogen. A broad range of microorganisms encoding
	BspA-like proteins was identified and these are mainly known to live
	on mucosal surfaces, among these T. vaginalis is endowed with the
	largest gene family. Over 190 TvBspA proteins with inferred transmembrane
	domains were characterised by a considerable structural diversity
	between their TpLRR and other types of repetitive sequences and two
	subfamilies possessed distinct classic sorting signal motifs for
	endocytosis. One TvBspA subfamily also shared a glycine-rich protein
	domain with proteins from Clostridium difficile pathogenic strains
	and C. difficile phages. Consistent with the hypothesis that TvBspA
	protein structural diversity implies diverse roles, we demonstrated
	for several TvBspA genes differential expression at the transcript
	level in different growth conditions. Identified variants of repetitive
	segments between several TvBspA paralogues and orthologues from two
	clinical isolates were also consistent with TpLRR and other repetitive
	sequences to be functionally important. For one TvBspA protein cell
	surface expression and antibody responses by both female and male
	T. vaginalis infected patients were also demonstrated. Conclusions:
	The biased mucosal habitat for microbial species encoding BspA-like
	proteins, the characterisation of a vast structural diversity for
	the TvBspA proteins, differential expression of a subset of TvBspA
	genes and the cellular localisation and immunological data for one
	TvBspA; all point to the importance of the TvBspA proteins to various

  abstract = {{Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) constitute a key antibiotic-resistance
	mechanism affecting Gram-negative bacteria, and also an excellent
	model for studying evolution in real time. A shift in the epidemiology
	of ESBLs is being observed, which is characterized by the explosive
	diversification and increase in frequency of the CTX-M-type beta-lactamases
	in different settings. This provides a unique opportunity for studying
	a protein evolutionary radiation by the sequential acquisition of
	specific mutations enhancing protein efficiency and fitness concomitantly.
	The existence of driver antibiotic molecules favoring protein divergence
	has been investigated by combining evolutionary analyses and experimental
	site-specific mutagenesis. Phylogenetic reconstruction with all the
	CTX-M variants described so far provided a hypothetical evolutionary
	scenario showing at least three diversification events. CTX-M-3 was
	likely the enzyme at the origin of the diversification in the CTX-M-1
	cluster, which was coincident with positive selection acting on several
	amino acid positions. Sixty-three CTX-M-3 derivatives containing
	all combinations of mutations under positively selected positions
	were constructed, and their phenotypic efficiency was evaluated.
	The CTX-M-3 diversification process can only be explained in a complex
	selective landscape with at least two antibiotics (cefotaxime and
	ceftazidime), indicating the need to invoke mixtures of selective
	drivers in order to understand the final evolutionary outcome. Under
	this hypothesis, we found congruent results between the in silico
	and in vitro analyses of evolutionary trajectories. Three pathways
	driving the diversification of CTX-M-3 towards the most complex and
	efficient variants were identified. Whereas the P167S pathway has
	limited possibilities of further diversification, the D240G route
	shows a robust diversification network. In the third route, drift
	may have played a role in the early stages of CTX-M-3 evolution.
	Antimicrobial agents should not be considered only as selectors for
	efficient mechanisms of resistance but also as diversifying agents
	of the evolutionary trajectories. Different trajectories were identified
	using a combination of phylogenetic reconstructions and directed
	mutagenesis analyses, indicating that such an approach might be useful
	to fulfill the desirable goal of predicting evolutionary trajectories
	in antimicrobial resistance.}},

	HIV-1 pathogenesis. We established a list of human genes (n = 140)
	proposed to be involved in HIV-1 biology and pathogenesis and a control
	set of 100 random genes. We retrieved the orthologous genes from
	the genome of humans and of four nonhuman primates (Pan troglodytes,
	Pongo pygmaeus abeli, Macaca mulatta, and Callithrix jacchus) and
	analyzed the nucleotide substitution patterns of this data set using
	codon-based maximum likelihood procedures. In addition, we evaluated
	whether the candidate genes have been targets of recent positive
	selection in humans by analyzing HapMap Phase 2 single-nucleotide
	polymorphisms genotyped in a region centered on each candidate gene.
	A total of 1,064 sequences were used for the analyses. Similar median
	K-A/K-S values were estimated for the set of genes involved in HIV-1
	pathogenesis and for control genes, 0.19 and 0.15, respectively.
	However, genes of the innate immunity had median values of 0.37 (P
	value = 0.0001, compared with control genes), and genes of intrinsic
	cellular defense had K-A/K-S values around or greater than 1.0 (P

	However, we identified within or near these genes 24 polymorphisms

  abstract = {{Background: Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is
	a primordial process in development and its dysregulation has a central
	role in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Angiogenin (ANG), a peculiar
	member of the RNase A superfamily, is a potent inducer of angiogenesis
	involved in many different types of cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
	and also with a possible role in the innate immune defense. The evolutionary
	path of this family has been a highly dynamic one, where positive
	selection has played a strong role. In this work we used a combined
	gene and protein level approach to determine the main sites under
	diversifying selection on the primate ANG gene and analyze its structural
	and functional implications. Results: We obtained evidence for positive
	selection in the primate ANG gene. Site specific analysis pointed
	out 15 sites under positive selection, most of which also exhibited
	drastic changes in amino acid properties. The mapping of these sites
	in the ANG 3D-structure described five clusters, four of which were
	located in functional regions: two in the active site region, one
	in the nucleolar location signal and one in the cell- binding site.
	Eight of the 15 sites under selection in the primate ANG gene were
	highly or moderately conserved in the RNase A family, suggesting
	a directed event and not a simple consequence of local structural
	or functional permissiveness. Moreover, 11 sites were exposed to
	the surface of the protein indicating that they may influence the
	interactions performed by ANG. Conclusion: Using a maximum likelihood
	gene level analysis we identified 15 sites under positive selection
	in the primate ANG genes, that were further corroborated through
	a protein level analysis of radical changes in amino acid properties.
	These sites mapped onto the main functional regions of the ANG protein.
	The fact that evidence for positive selection is present in all ANG
	regions required for angiogenesis may be a good indication that angiogenesis
	is the process under selection. However, other possibilities to be
	considered arise from the possible involvement of ANG in innate immunity
	and the potential influence or co-evolution with its interacting
	proteins and ligands.}},

  abstract = {{Sexual communication in plethodontid salamanders is mediated by a
	proteinaceous pheromone that a male delivers to a female during courtship,
	boosting her receptivity. The pheromone consists of three proteins
	from three unrelated protein families. These proteins are among a
	small group of pheromones known to affect female receptivity in vertebrates.
	Previously, we showed that the genes of two of these proteins (PRF
	and SPF) are prone to incessant evolution driven by positive selection,
	presumably as a consequence of coevolution with female receptors.
	In this report, we focus on the evolution of the third pheromone
	protein gene family, plethodontid modulating factor (PMF), to determine
	whether it shows the same pattern of diversification. We used RT-PCR
	in mental gland cDNA to survey PMF sequences from three genera of
	plethodontid salamanders (27 spp.) to measure rates of evolution,
	level of gene diversification, modes of selection, and types of amino
	acid substitution. Like PRF and SPF, PMF is produced by a multigene
	family characterized by gene duplication and high levels of polymorphism.
	PMF evolution is rapid, incessant, and driven by positive selection.
	PMF is more extreme in these dimensions than both PRF and SPF. Nestled
	within this extraordinary variation, however, is a signature of purifying
	selection, acting to preserve important structural and biochemical
	features of the PMF protein (i.e., secretion signal, cysteine residues,
	and pI). Although a pattern of persistent diversification exists
	at the molecular level, the morphological and behavioral aspects
	of the pheromone delivery system show evolutionary stasis over millions
	of years.}},

	However, few in silico studies were interested in tracking such changes

	an opportunity to fill this gap because it is involved in vertebrate
	skin appendage development such as scales, teeth, hair, and feathers
	that take an obvious part in the adaptation of species to their environment.
	We benefited from the large amount of genomic data now available

	In mammals, these genes are eda ( encoding 2 ligands, EDA- A1 and
	EDA- A2), edar ( EDA- A1 receptor), edaradd ( EDA receptor {[} EDAR]
	adapter), xedar ( EDA- A2 receptor), and troy ( a XEDARrelated receptor).
	We show that the evolution of EDA pathway genes combines both strongly
	conserved features and evolutionary shifts. These shifts are found

	signaling) and at different taxonomic levels ( class, suborder, and

	Site-specific analyses of positive Darwinian selection revealed relatively
	high rates of synonymous substitution in the A. thaliana ARFs of

	Primary auxin responsive gene families (GH3, SAUR, LBD) show different

	rapid auxin response. The spatial separation of the Q-rich activator

	7q35, while PRSS3 is found on chromosome 9p13. Here, we report a
	variation of the theme of new gene creation by duplication: the PRSS3
	gene was formed by segmental duplications originating from chromosomes
	7q35 and 11q24. As a result, PRSS3 transcripts display two variants
	of exon 1. The PRSS3 transcript whose gene organization most resembles
	PRSSI and PRSS2 encodes a functional protein originally named mesotrypsinogen.
	The other variant is a fusion transcript, called trypsinogen IV.
	We show that the first exon of trypsinogen IV is derived from the
	noncoding first exon of LOC120224, a chromosome I I gene. LOC120224
	codes for a widely conserved transmembrane protein of unknown function.
	Comparative analyses suggest that these interchromosomal duplications
	occurred after the divergence of Old World monkeys and hominids.
	PRSS3 transcripts consist of a mixed population of mRNAs, some expressed
	in the pancreas and encoding an apparently functional trypsinogen
	and others of unknown function expressed in brain and a variety of
	other tissues. Analysis of the selection pressures acting on the
	trypsinogen gene family shows that, while the apparently functional
	genes are under mild to strong purifying selection overall, a few
	residues appear under positive selection. These residues could be
	involved in interactions with inhibitors.}},

	the challenge of contributing to this theoretical ground by investigating
	the hetero-oligomerism in the molecular chaperonin cytosolic chaperonin
	containing tailless complex polypeptide 1 (CCT) from archaea. CCT
	is amenable to this study because, in contrast to eukaryotic CCTs
	where sub-functionalization after gene duplication has been taken
	to completion, archaeal CCTs present no evidence for subunit functional
	specialization. Our analyses yield additional information to previous
	reports on archaeal CCT paralogy by identifying new duplication events.
	Analyses of selective constraints show that amino acid sites from
	I subunit have fixed slightly deleterious mutations at inter-subunit
	interfaces after gene duplication. These mutations have been followed
	by compensatory mutations in nearby regions of the same subunit and
	in the interface contact regions of its paralogous subunit. The strong
	selective constraints in these regions after speciation support the
	evolutionary entrapment of CCTs as hetero-oligomers. In addition,
	our results unveil different evolutionary dynamics depending on the
	degree of CCT hetero-oligomerism. Archaeal CCT protein complexes
	comprising 3 distinct classes of subunits present 2 evolutionary
	processes. First, slightly deleterious and compensatory mutations
	were fixed neutrally at inter-subunit regions. Second, sub-functionalization
	may have occurred at substrate-binding and adenosine triphosphate-binding
	regions after the 2nd gene duplication event took place. CCTs with
	2 distinct types of subunits did not present evidence of sub-functionalization.

	analysis tools to assess the evolution of lysozymes from three congeneric

	Their lysozymes fall into three distinct clades, one belonging to
	the invertebrate-type and the other two to the protist-type lysozymes.
	Their diversification is characterised by (i) ancestral gene duplications
	preceding species separation followed by maintenance of genes, (ii)

	with endosymbiotic dinoflagellates ( Symbiodinium spp.), with which
	they are obligately symbiotic. To develop a foundation for studying
	coral biology and coral symbiosis, we have constructed a set of cDNA
	libraries and generated and annotated ESTs from two species of corals,
	Acropora palmata and Montastraea faveolata. Results: We generated
	14,588 ( Ap) and 3,854 ( Mf) high quality ESTs from five life history/
	symbiosis stages ( spawned eggs, early-stage planula larvae, late-
	stage planula larvae either infected with symbionts or uninfected,
	and adult coral). The ESTs assembled into a set of primarily stage-
	specific clusters, producing 4,980 ( Ap), and 1,732 ( Mf) unigenes.
	The egg stage library, relative to the other developmental stages,
	was enriched in genes functioning in cell division and proliferation,
	transcription, signal transduction, and regulation of protein function.
	Fifteen unigenes were identified as candidate symbiosis- related
	genes as they were expressed in all libraries constructed from the
	symbiotic stages and were absent from all of the non symbiotic stages.
	These include several DNA interacting proteins, and one highly expressed
	unigene ( containing 17 cDNAs) with no significant protein- coding
	region. A significant number of unigenes ( 25) encode potential pattern
	recognition receptors ( lectins, scavenger receptors, and others),
	as well as genes that may function in signaling pathways involved
	in innate immune responses ( toll- like signaling, NFkB p105, and
	MAP kinases). Comparison between the A. palmata and an A. millepora
	EST dataset identified ferritin as a highly expressed gene in both
	datasets that appears to be undergoing adaptive evolution. Five unigenes
	appear to be restricted to the Scleractinia, as they had no homology
	to any sequences in the nr databases nor to the non- scleractinian
	cnidarians Nematostella vectensis and Hydra magnipapillata. Conclusion:
	Partial sequencing of 5 cDNA libraries each for A. palmata and M.
	faveolata has produced a rich set of candidate genes ( 4,980 genes
	from A. palmata, and 1,732 genes from M. faveolata) that we can use

  abstract = {{Background: In pathogens, certain genes encoding proteins that directly
	interact with host defences coevolve with their host and are subject
	to positive selection. In the lepidopteran host-wasp parasitoid system,
	one of the most original strategies developed by the wasps to defeat
	host defences is the injection of a symbiotic polydnavirus at the
	same time as the wasp eggs. The virus is essential for wasp parasitism
	success since viral gene expression alters the immune system and
	development of the host. As a wasp mutualist symbiont, the virus
	is expected to exhibit a reduction in genome complexity and evolve
	under wasp phyletic constraints. However, as a lepidopteran host
	pathogenic symbiont, the virus is likely undergoing strong selective
	pressures for the acquisition of new functions by gene acquisition
	or duplication. To understand the constraints imposed by this particular
	system on virus evolution, we studied a polydnavirus gene family
	encoding cyteine protease inhibitors of the cystatin superfamily.
	Results: We show that cystatins are the first bracovirus genes proven
	to be subject to strong positive selection within a host-parasitoid
	system. A generated three-dimensional model of Cotesia congregata
	bracovirus cystatin 1 provides a powerful framework to position positively
	selected residues and reveal that they are concentrated in the vicinity
	of actives sites which interact with cysteine proteases directly.
	In addition, phylogenetic analyses reveal two different cystatin
	forms which evolved under different selective constraints and are
	characterized by independent adaptive duplication events. Conclusion:
	Positive selection acts to maintain cystatin gene duplications and
	induces directional divergence presumably to ensure the presence
	of efficient and adapted cystatin forms. Directional selection has
	acted on key cystatin active sites, suggesting that cystatins coevolve
	with their host target. We can strongly suggest that cystatins constitute
	major virulence factors, as was already proposed in previous functional

	maniculatus) are attributable Loa relaxation of purifying selection
	or to ahistoiy of positive selection that has adapted the gene products

	two paralogs at the 5'-end of the alpha-globin gene cluster (HBA-T1
	and HBA-T2) are evolving in concert and are therefore identical or
	nearly identical in sequence. However, in each case, the HBA-T1 and
	HBA-T2 paralogs are distinguished from the third paralog at the 3'-end
	of the gene cluster (HBA-T3) by multiple amino acid substitutions.
	An analysis of genomic sequence data from several rodent species
	revealed that the HBA-T3 genes of Rattus and Peromyscus originated
	via independent, lineage-specific duplication events. In the independently
	derived HBA-T3 genes of both species, a likelihood analysis based
	on a codon-substitution model revealed that accelerated rates of
	amino acid substitution are attributable to positive directional
	selection, not to a relaxation of purifying selection. As a result
	of functional divergence among the triplicated alpha-globin genes
	in Rattus and Peromyscus, the red blood cells of both rodent species
	contain a mixture of functionally distinct alpha-chain hemoglobin
	isoforms that are predicted to have different oxygen-binding affinities.
	In P. maniculatus, a species that is able to sustain physiological

  abstract = {{Background: Gene duplication provides raw genetic materials for evolutionary
	novelty and adaptation. The evolutionary fate of duplicated transcription
	factor genes is less studied although transcription factor gene plays
	important roles in many biological processes. TFIIA gamma is a small
	subunit of TFIIA that is one of general transcription factors required
	by RNA polymerase II. Previous studies identified two TFIIA gamma-like
	genes in rice genome and found that these genes either conferred
	resistance to rice bacterial blight or could be induced by pathogen
	invasion, raising the question as to their functional divergence
	and evolutionary fates after gene duplication. Results: We reconstructed
	the evolutionary history of the TFIIA gamma genes from main lineages
	of angiosperms and demonstrated that two TFIIA gamma genes (TFIIA
	gamma 1 and TFIIA gamma 5) arose from a whole genome duplication
	that happened in the common ancestor of grasses. Likelihood-based
	analyses with branch, codon, and branch-site models showed no evidence
	of positive selection but a signature of relaxed selective constraint
	after the TFIIA gamma duplication. In particular, we found that the
	nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (omega = d(N)/d(S)) of the TFIIA
	gamma 1 sequences was two times higher than that of TFIIA gamma 5
	sequences, indicating highly asymmetric rates of protein evolution
	in rice tribe and its relatives, with an accelerated rate of TFIIA
	gamma 1 gene. Our expression data and EST database search further
	indicated that after whole genome duplication, the expression of
	TFIIA gamma 1 gene was significantly reduced while TFIIA gamma 5
	remained constitutively expressed and maintained the ancestral role
	as a subunit of the TFIIA complex. Conclusion: The evolutionary fate
	of TFIIA gamma duplicates is not consistent with the neofunctionalization
	model that predicts that one of the duplicated genes acquires a new
	function because of positive Darwinian selection. Instead, we suggest
	that subfunctionalization might be involved in TFIIA gamma evolution
	in grasses. The fact that both TFIIA gamma 1 and TFIIA gamma 5 genes
	were effectively involved in response to biotic or abiotic factors
	might be explained by either Dykhuizen-Hartl effect or buffering

  abstract = {{Background: Gonorrhea is a major sexually transmitted disease (STD)
	in many countries worldwide. The emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance
	has complicated efforts to control and treat this disease. We report
	the first study of the evolutionary processes acting on transmission
	dynamics of a resistant gonococcal population from Shanghai, China.
	We compare these findings with our previous study of the evolution
	of a fluoroquinolone sensitive gonococcal population from Baltimore,
	MD. Methods: Ninety six gonococcal samples were collected from male
	patients in Shanghai, China. All samples were fluoroquinolone resistant.
	Seven MLST housekeeping genes, two fluoroquinolone resistance genes
	(gyrA and parC) and the porB gene were sequenced and subjected to
	population genetic and evolutionary analyses. We estimated genetic
	diversity, recombination, growth, and selective pressure. The evolutionary
	history and population dynamics of the Shanghai population were also
	inferred and compared with that observed in a fluoroquinolone sensitive
	gonococcal population from Baltimore. Results: For both populations,
	mutation plays a larger role than recombination in the evolution
	of the porB gene, whereas the latter seems to be the main force driving
	the evolution of housekeeping and fluoroquinolone resistance genes.
	In both populations there was evidence for positively selected sites
	in all genes analyzed. The phylogenetic analyses showed no temporal
	clustering in the Shanghai gonococcal population, nor did we detect
	shared allelic profiles between the Shanghai and the Baltimore populations.
	Past population dynamics of gonococcal strains from Shanghai showed
	a rising relative effective population size (Ne) in MLST genes with
	a declining relative Ne for gyrA and parC, whereas among sensitive
	strains from Baltimore we previously observed concordance among these
	genes. In both Shanghai and Baltimore, the past population dynamics
	of gonococcal strains tracked changes in the prevalence of gonorrhea.
	Conclusions: Our study illustrates both similarities and differences
	in the evolutionary processes acting on gonococcal populations in
	different geographic areas. An explanation of this pattern that may
	apply in China is the continued use of quinolone antibiotics despite
	widespread resistance. Population genetic analysis of gonococcal
	strains in conjunction with epidemiological surveillance may provide
	insights into the epidemic behavior of antibiotic resistant strains
	and help to design control measures.}},

	of predominant mammalian blood feeding in this species. Plasminogen
	activator has evolved through gene duplication, domain loss, and
	sequence evolution leading to change in fibrin-specificity and susceptibility
	to plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Before undertaking this study,

  abstract = {{Background: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are an essential component
	of innate immunity which can rapidly respond to diverse microbial
	pathogens. Insects, as a rich source of AMPs, attract great attention
	of scientists in both understanding of the basic biology of the immune

	different insect species, little information in terms of these peptides
	is available from parasitic insects. Results: By using integrated
	computational approaches to systemically mining the Hymenopteran
	parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis genome, we establish the first
	AMP repertoire whose members exhibit extensive sequence and structural
	diversity and can be distinguished into multiple molecular types,

	Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera) and several non-Hymenopteran model insects,
	N. vitripennis has evolved a complex antimicrobial immune system
	with more genes and larger protein precursors. Three classical strategies

  month = {{AUG 14}},
  abstract = {{Background: NLRPs (Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, Leucine
	rich Repeat and Pyrin domain containing Proteins) are members of
	NLR (Nod-like receptors) protein family. Recent researches have shown
	that NLRP genes play important roles in both mammalian innate immune
	system and reproductive system. Several of NLRP genes were shown
	to be specifically expressed in the oocyte in mammals. The aim of
	the present work was to study how these genes evolved and diverged
	after their duplication, as well as whether natural selection played
	a role during their evolution. Results: By using in silico methods,
	we have evaluated the evolution and functional divergence of NLRP
	genes, in particular of mouse reproduction-related Nlrp genes. We
	found that (1) major NLRP genes have been duplicated before the divergence
	of mammals, with certain lineage-specific duplications in primates
	(NLRP7 and 11) and in rodents (Nlrp1, 4 and 9 duplicates); (2) tandem
	duplication events gave rise to a mammalian reproduction-related
	NLRP cluster including NLRP2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 and 14 genes;
	(3) the function of mammalian oocyte-specific NLRP genes (NLRP4,
	5, 9 and 14) might have diverged during gene evolution; (4) recent
	segmental duplications concerning Nlrp4 copies and vomeronasal 1
	receptor encoding genes (V1r) have been undertaken in the mouse;
	and (5) duplicates of Nlrp4 and 9 in the mouse might have been subjected
	to adaptive evolution. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study brings
	us novel information on the evolution of mammalian reproduction-related
	NLRPs. On the one hand, NLRP genes duplicated and functionally diversified
	in mammalian reproductive systems (such as NLRP4, 5, 9 and 14). On
	the other hand, during evolution, different lineages adapted to develop
	their own NLRP genes, particularly in reproductive function (such

  abstract = {{Background: Related species, such as humans and chimpanzees, often

	as in AIDS. Furthermore, certain diseases such as schizophrenia,
	epithelial cancers and autoimmune disorders are far more frequent

	Genes that have undergone positive selection during species evolution
	are indicative of functional adaptations that drive species differences.
	Thus we investigate whether biomedical disease differences between
	species can be attributed to positively selected genes. Results:
	We identified genes that putatively underwent positive selection
	during the evolution of humans and four mammals which are often used
	to model human diseases (mouse, rat, chimpanzee and dog). We show
	that genes predicted to have been subject to positive selection pressure
	during human evolution are implicated in diseases such as epithelial
	cancers, schizophrenia, autoimmune diseases and Alzheimer's disease,
	all of which differ in prevalence and symptomatology between humans
	and their mammalian relatives. In agreement with previous studies,
	the chimpanzee lineage was found to have more genes under positive
	selection than any of the other lineages. In addition, we found new
	evidence to support the hypotheseis that genes that have undergone

	whole, are characterized by a high variation in petal and stamen
	morphology. Moreover, the Stamen number, the adnation of stamens
	to petals, and the degree of sympetaly vary considerably among basal
	asterid taxa. The B group genes, members of the APETALA3 (AP3) and
	PISTILLATA (PI) gene lineages, have been shown to specify petal and
	stamen identities in several core eudicot species. Duplicate genes
	in these lineages have been shown in some cases to have diversified
	in their function; for instance in Petunia, a PI paralog is required
	for the fusion of stamens to the corolla tube, illustrating that
	such genes belonging to this lineage are not just involved in specifying
	the identity of the stamens and petals but can also specify novel
	floral morphologies. This motivated us to study the duplication history
	of class B genes throughout asterid lineages, which comprise approximately
	one-third of all flowering plants. The evolutionary history of the
	PI gene subfamily indicates that the two genes in Petunia result
	from an ancient duplication event, coinciding with the origin of
	core asterids. A second duplication event occurred before the speciation
	of basal asterid Ericales families. These mid other duplications
	in the PI lineage are not correlated with duplications in the AP3

	genes after duplication, we have described their expression patterns
	using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ
	hybridization, reconstructed how selection shaped their protein sequences

	B proteins. We find that after duplication, PI paralogs have acquired
	multiple different expression patterns and negative selective pressure
	on their codons is relaxed, whereas substitutions in sites putatively
	involved in protein-protein interactions show positive selection,

  abstract = {{Background: Forkhead box, class O (FoxO) belongs to the large family
	of forkhead transcription factors that are characterized by a conserved
	forkhead box DNA-binding domain. To date, the FoxO group has four
	mammalian members: FoxO1, FoxO3a, FoxO4 and FoxO6, which are orthologs
	of DAF16, an insulin-responsive transcription factor involved in
	regulating longevity of worms and flies. The degree of homology between
	these four members is high, especially in the forkhead domain, which
	contains the DNA-binding interface. Yet, mouse FoxO knockouts have
	revealed that each FoxO gene has its unique role in the physiological
	process. Whether the functional divergences are primarily due to
	adaptive selection pressure or relaxed selective constraint remains
	an open question. As such, this study aims to address the evolutionary
	mode of FoxO, which may lead to the functional divergence. Results:
	Sequence similarity searches have performed in genome and scaffold
	data to identify homologues of FoxO in vertebrates. Phylogenetic
	analysis was used to characterize the family evolutionary history
	by identifying two duplications early in vertebrate evolution. To
	determine the mode of evolution in vertebrates, we performed a rigorous
	statistical analysis with FoxO gene sequences, including relative
	rate ratio tests, branch-specific d(N)/d(S) ratio tests, site-specific
	d(N)/d(S) ratio tests, branch-site d(N)/d(S) ratio tests and clade
	level amino acid conservation/variation patterns analysis. Our results
	suggest that FoxO is constrained by strong purifying selection except
	four sites in FoxO6, which have undergone positive Darwinian selection.
	The functional divergence in this family is best explained by either
	relaxed purifying selection or positive selection. Conclusion: We
	present a phylogeny describing the evolutionary history of the FoxO
	gene family and show that the genes have evolved through duplications
	followed by purifying selection except for four sites in FoxO6 fixed
	by positive selection lie mostly within the non-conserved optimal

	sequences in our analysis as outgroups, we confirmed the phylogenetic
	position of the gamma N family as sister to other gamma crystallins.
	Using maximum likelihood codon models to estimate lineage-specific
	nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate ratios revealed strong positive
	selection in all of the early lineages within the beta gamma family,
	with the striking exception of the lineage leading to the gamma N
	crystallins which was characterized by strong purifying selection.
	Branch-site analysis, used to identify candidate sites involved in
	functional divergence between gamma N crystallins and its sister
	clade containing all other gamma crystallins, identified several
	positively selected changes at sites of known functional importance
	in the beta gamma crystallin protein structure. Further analyses
	of a fish-specific gamma N crystallin gene duplication revealed a
	more recent episode of positive selection in only one of the two
	descendant lineages (gamma N2). Finally, from the guppy, Poecilia
	reticulata, we isolated complete gamma N1 and gamma N2 coding sequence
	data from cDNA and partial coding sequence data from genomic DNA
	in order to confirm the presence of a novel gamma N2 intron, discovered
	through data mining of two pufferfish genomes. We conclude that the
	function of the gamma N family likely resembles the ancestral vertebrate
	beta gamma crystallin more than other beta gamma families. Furthermore,
	owing to the presence of an additional intron in some fish gamma
	N2 crystallins, and the inferred action of positive selection following
	the fish-specific gamma N duplication, we suggest that further study
	of fish gamma N crystallins will be critical in further elucidating
	possible ancestral functions of gamma N crystallins and any nonstructural

  abstract = {{Background: The diversity of visual systems in fish has long been
	of interest for evolutionary biologists and neurophysiologists, and
	has recently begun to attract the attention of molecular evolutionary
	geneticists. Several recent studies on the copy number and genomic
	organization of visual pigment proteins, the opsins, have revealed
	an increased opsin diversity in fish relative to most vertebrates,
	brought about through recent instances of opsin duplication and divergence.
	However, for the subfamily of opsin genes that mediate vision at
	the long-wavelength end of the spectrum, the LWS opsins, it appears
	that most fishes possess only one or two loci, a value comparable
	to most other vertebrates. Here, we characterize the LWS opsins from
	cDNA of an individual guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a fish that is
	known exhibit variation in its long-wavelength sensitive visual system,
	mate preferences and colour patterns. Results: We identified six
	LWS opsins expressed within a single individual. Phylogenetic analysis
	revealed that these opsins descend from duplication events both pre-dating
	and following the divergence of the guppy lineage from that of the
	bluefin killifish, Lucania goodei, the closest species for which
	comparable data exists. Numerous amino acid substitutions exist among
	these different LWS opsins, many at sites known to be important for
	visual pigment function, including spectral sensitivity and G-protein
	activation. Likelihood analyses using codon-based models of evolution
	reveal significant changes in selective constraint along two of the
	guppy LWS opsin lineages. Conclusion: The guppy displays an unusually
	high number of LWS opsins compared to other fish, and to vertebrates
	in general. Observing both substitutions at functionally important
	sites and the persistence of lineages across species boundaries suggests
	that these opsins might have functionally different roles, especially
	with regard to G-protein activation. The reasons why are currently
	unknown, but may relate to aspects of the guppy's behavioural ecology,
	in which both male colour patterns and the female mate preferences
	for these colour patterns experience strong, highly variable selection
	pressures.}},

  abstract = {{Background: Cattle and other ruminants have evolved the ability to
	derive most of their metabolic energy requirement from otherwise
	indigestible plant matter through a symbiotic relationship with plant
	fibre degrading microbes within a specialised fermentation chamber,
	the rumen. The genetic changes underlying the evolution of the ruminant
	lifestyle are poorly understood. The BPI-like locus encodes several
	putative innate immune proteins, expressed predominantly in the oral

	Increasing protein (BPI). We have previously reported the expression
	of variant BPI-like proteins in cattle (Biochim Biophys Acta 2002,

	lead to a better understanding of the role of the BPI-like proteins
	in cattle physiology Results: We have sequenced and characterised
	a 722 kbp segment of BTA13 containing the bovine BPI-like protein
	locus. Nine of the 13 contiguous BPI- like genes in the locus in
	cattle are orthologous to genes in the human and mouse locus, and
	are thought to play a role in host defence. Phylogenetic analysis
	indicates the remaining four genes, which we have named BSP30A, BSP30B,
	BSP30C and BSP30D, appear to have arisen in cattle through a series
	of duplications. The transcripts of the four BSP30 genes are most
	abundant in tissues associated with the oral cavity and airways.
	BSP30C transcripts are also found in the abomasum. This, as well
	as the ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous differences between
	pairs of the BSP30 genes, is consistent with at least BSP30C having
	acquired a distinct function from the other BSP30 proteins and from
	its paralog in human and mouse, parotid secretory protein (PSP).
	Conclusion: The BPI- like locus in mammals appears to have evolved
	rapidly through multiple gene duplication events, and is thus a hot
	spot for genome evolution. It is possible that BSP30 gene duplication
	is a characteristic feature of ruminants and that the BSP30 proteins

  year = {{2008}},
  volume = {{8}},
  month = {{APR 11}},
  abstract = {{Background: Comparative sequencing studies among a wide range of
	taxonomic groups, including fungi, have led to the discovery that
	reproductive genes evolve more rapidly than other genes. However,
	for fungal reproductive genes the question has remained whether the
	rapid evolution is a result of stochastic or deterministic processes.
	The mating-type (mat) genes constitute the master regulators of sexual
	reproduction in filamentous ascomycetes and here we present a study
	of the molecular evolution of the four mat-genes (mat a-1, mat A-1,
	mat A-2 and mat A-3) of 20 Neurospora taxa. Results: We estimated
	nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates of genes to infer
	their evolutionary rate, and confirmed that the mat-genes evolve
	rapidly. Furthermore, the evolutionary trajectories are related to
	the reproductive modes of the taxa; likelihood methods revealed that
	positive selection acting on specific codons drives the diversity
	in heterothallic taxa, while among homothallic taxa the rapid evolution
	is due to a lack of selective constraint. The latter finding is supported
	by presence of stop codons and frame shift mutations disrupting the
	open reading frames of mat a-1, mat A-2 and mat A-3 in homothallic
	taxa. Lower selective constraints of matgenes was found among homothallic
	than heterothallic taxa, and comparisons with nonreproductive genes
	argue that this disparity is not a nonspecific, genome-wide phenomenon.
	Conclusion: Our data show that the mat-genes evolve rapidly in Neurospora.
	The rapid divergence is due to either adaptive evolution or lack
	of selective constraints, depending on the reproductive mode of the
	taxa. This is the first instance of positive selection acting on
	reproductive genes in the fungal kingdom, and illustrates how the
	evolutionary trajectory of reproductive genes can change after a

	GPC and GPD is a uniquely human trait, caused by the evolution of
	the GPC start codon in the human lineage. The pattern of polymorphism
	among humans is consistent with a hitchhiking event at the locus,
	suggesting that positive natural selection affected GYPC in the relatively
	recent past. Because GPC is exploited by P. falciparum for invasion
	of the red blood cell, we hypothesize that selection for evasion

	a new start codon. In the case of human GYPC, the ancestral protein

	mammals in the modern Holarctic Region, live in cold regions at either

	Variations in energy metabolism are remarkable for them living in
	cold environments. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, plays important
	roles in energy homeostasis. Methodology/Principal Findings. To examine
	the extent of leptin variations within the Ochotona family, we cloned
	the entire coding sequence of pika leptin from 6 species in two regions
	(Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Inner Mongolia steppe in China) and the
	leptin sequences of plateau pikas (O. curzonia) from different altitudes

	sequence analyses in molecular evolution and compared modeled spatial
	structures. Our results show that positive selection (PS) acts on
	pika leptin, while nine PS sites located within the functionally
	significant segment 85-119 of leptin and one unique motif appeared
	only in pika lineages-the ATP synthase a and b subunit signature

	altitudes. Stepwise multiple regression shows that temperature is
	significantly and negatively correlated with the rates of non-synonymous
	substitution (Ka) and amino acid substitution (Aa), whereas altitude
	does not significantly affect synonymous substitution (Ks), Ka and
	Aa. Conclusions/Significance. Our findings support the viewpoint
	that adaptive evolution may occur in pika leptin, which may play
	important roles in pikas' ecological adaptation to extreme environmental
	stress. We speculate that cold, and probably not hypoxia, may be

	Phylogenetic analysis of 1.3-kb partial DNA sequences of GH genes

	Both duplicates and their open-reading frames are preserved throughout

	relatives. In addition, although the 84 codons sequenced are generally
	highly conserved for both passerines and nonpasserines, comparisons
	of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution ratios and the rate
	of predicted amino acid changes indicate that the 2 gene duplicates

  abstract = {{The genome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) provides a striking example
	of gene overlapping. In particular, the surface protein gene S is
	overlapped completely by the polymerase gene P. Evolutionary constraints
	in overlapping genes have been demonstrated for many viruses, with
	one of the two overlapping genes being subjected to positive selection
	(adaptive evolution), while the other one is subjected to purifying
	selection. Yet, for HBV to persist successfully, adaptive evolution
	of both the P and S genes is essential. We propose that HBV employs
	a mechanism that allows the independent adaptive evolution of both
	genes. We hypothesize that (i) the adaptive evolution of P occurs
	via p1/s3 non-synonymous substitutions, which are synonymous in S,
	(ii) the adaptive evolution of S occurs via p3/s2 non-synonymous
	substitutions, which are synonymous in P, and (iii) p2/s1 substitutions
	are rare. Analysis of 450 HBV sequences demonstrated that this mechanism
	is operational in HBV evolution both within and among genotypes.
	Positions were identified in both genes where adaptive evolution
	is operational. Whilst significant parts of the P and S genes were
	subjected to positive selection, with the K-a/K-s ratio for either
	the P or the S gene being >1, there were only a few regions where
	the K-a/K-s ratios in both genes were >1. This mechanism of independent
	evolution of the overlapping regions could also apply to other viruses,
	taking into account the increased frequency of amino acids with a
	high level of degeneracy in the proteins encoded by overlapping genes
	of viruses.}},

  abstract = {{Background: It is believed that animal-to-human transmission of severe
	acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) is the cause
	of the SARS outbreak worldwide. The spike ( S) protein is one of
	the best characterized proteins of SARS-CoV, which plays a key role
	in SARS-CoV overcoming species barrier and accomplishing interspecies
	transmission from animals to humans, suggesting that it may be the
	major target of selective pressure. However, the process of adaptive
	evolution of S protein and the exact positively selected sites associated
	with this process remain unknown. Results: By investigating the adaptive
	evolution of S protein, we identified twelve amino acid sites ( 75,
	239, 244, 311, 479, 609, 613, 743, 765, 778, 1148, and 1163) in the
	S protein under positive selective pressure. Based on phylogenetic
	tree and epidemiological investigation, SARS outbreak was divided
	into three epidemic groups: 02-04 interspecies, 03-early- mid, and
	03-late epidemic groups in the present study. Positive selection
	was detected in the first two groups, which represent the course
	of SARS-CoV interspecies transmission and of viral adaptation to
	human host, respectively. In contrast, purifying selection was detected
	in 03-late group. These indicate that S protein experiences variable
	positive selective pressures before reaching stabilization. A total
	of 25 sites in 02-04 interspecies epidemic group and 16 sites in
	03-early- mid epidemic group were identified under positive selection.
	The identified sites were different between these two groups except
	for site 239, which suggests that positively selected sites are changeable
	between groups. Moreover, it was showed that a larger proportion
	(24\%) of positively selected sites was located in receptor- binding
	domain (RBD) than in heptad repeat (HR) 1-HR2 region in 02-04 interspecies
	epidemic group (p = 0.0208), and a greater percentage (25\%) of these
	sites occurred in HR1-HR2 region than in RBD in 03-early- mid epidemic
	group (p = 0.0721). These suggest that functionally different domains
	of S protein may not experience same positive selection in each epidemic
	group. In addition, three specific replacements (F360S, T487S and
	L665S) were only found between 03-human SARS-CoVs and strains from
	02-04 interspecies epidemic group, which reveals that selective sweep
	may also force the evolution of S genes before the jump of SARS-CoVs
	into human hosts. Since certain residues at these positively selected
	sites are associated with receptor recognition and/or membrane fusion,
	they are likely to be the crucial residues for animal-to-human transmission
	of SARS-CoVs, and subsequent adaptation to human hosts. Conclusion:
	The variation of positive selective pressures and positively selected
	sites are likely to contribute to the adaptive evolution of S protein
	from animals to humans.}},

	has been a subject of considerable interest. However, positive selection
	is difficult to detect because it often operates episodically on
	a few amino acid sites, and the signal may be masked by negative
	selection. Several methods have been developed to test positive selection
	that acts on given branches (branch methods) or on a subset of sites
	(site methods). Recently, Yang, Z., and R. Nielsen (2002. Codon-substitution
	models for detecting molecular adaptation at individual sites along
	specific lineages. Mol. Biol. Evol. 19:908-917) developed likelihood
	ratio tests (LRTs) based on branch-site models to detect positive
	selection that affects a small number of sites along prespecified
	lineages. However, computer simulations suggested that the tests
	were sensitive to the model assumptions and were unable to distinguish
	between relaxation of selective constraint and positive selection
	(Zhang, J. 2004. Frequent false detection of positive selection by
	the likelihood method with branch-site models. Mol. Biol. Evol. 21:1332-1339).
	Here, we describe a modified branch-site model and use it to construct
	two LRTs, called branch-site tests 1 and 2. We applied the new tests
	to reanalyze several real data sets and used computer simulation
	to examine the performance of the two tests by examining their false-positive
	rate, power, and robustness. We found that test 1 was unable to distinguish
	relaxed constraint from positive selection affecting the lineages
	of interest, while test 2 had acceptable false-positive rates and
	appeared robust against violations of model assumptions. As test
	2 is a direct test of positive selection on the lineages of interest,
	it is referred to as the branch-site test of positive selection and
	is recommended for use in real data analysis. The test appeared conservative
	overall, but exhibited better power in detecting positive selection
	than the branch-based test. Bayes empirical Bayes identification
	of amino acid sites under positive selection along the foreground
	branches was found to be reliable, but lacked power.}},

	during evolution, estimation of the time-scale with reliable calibrations

	the Cretaceous period, and provides a reliable calibration in studying
	the tempo and mode of grass chloroplast evolution. Methodology/Principal
	Findings: By using chloroplast genome data from angiosperms and by
	taking account of new paleontological evidence, we now show that
	episodic rate acceleration both in terms of non-synonymous and synonymous
	substitutions occurred in the common ancestral branch of the core
	Poaceae (a group formed by rice, wheat, maize, and their allies)
	accompanied by adaptive evolution in several chloroplast proteins,

	of episodic rate acceleration in the ancestral grasses accompanied
	by adaptive molecular evolution has a profound bearing on the evolution

	the assumption is proved to be inadequate in approximating the episodic

	Draba lineage and related lineages of Brassicaceae. Our phylogenetic
	analyses indicate that all COR15-like sequences clustered into four
	clades that corresponded well to the morphological lineages. Gene
	conversions were found to have probably occurred before/during the
	divergence of Brassica and Draba lineage. However, repeated, independent
	duplications of this gene have occurred in different lineages of
	Brassicaceae. Further comparisons of all sequences suggest that there
	have been significant inter-lineage differences in evolutionary rates
	between the duplicated and original genes. We assessed the likelihood
	that the differences between two well-supported gene subfamilies
	that appear to have originated from a single duplication, COR15a
	and COR15b, within the Draba lineage have been driven by adaptive
	evolution. Comparisons of their non-synonymous/synonymous substitution
	ratios and rates of predicted amino acid changes indicate that these
	two gene groups are evolving under different selective pressures
	and may be functionally divergent. This functional divergence was
	confirmed by comparing site-specific shifts in evolution indexes
	of the two groups of predicted proteins. The evidence of differential
	selection and possible functional divergence suggests that the duplication
	may be of adaptive significance, with possible implications for the
	explosive diversification of the Draba lineage during the cooling
	Quaternary stages and the following worldwide colonization of and
	alpine and artic regions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract = {{Positive selection for protein function can lead to multiple mutations
	within a small stretch of DNA, i.e., to a cluster of mutations. Recently,
	Wagner proposed a method to detect such mutation clusters. His method,
	however, did not take into account that residues with high solvent
	accessibility are inherently more variable than residues with low
	solvent accessibility. Here, we propose a new algorithm to detect
	clustered evolution. Our algorithm controls for different substitution
	probabilities at buried and exposed sites in the tertiary protein
	structure, and uses random permutations to calculate accurate P values
	for inferred clusters. We apply the algorithm to genomes of bacteria,
	fly, and mammals, and find several clusters of mutations in functionally
	important regions of proteins. Surprisingly, clustered evolution
	is a relatively rare phenomenon. Only between 2\% and 10\% of the
	genes we analyze contain a statistically significant mutation cluster.
	We also find that not controlling for solvent accessibility leads
	to an excess of clusters in terminal and solvent-exposed regions
	of proteins. Our algorithm provides a novel method to identify functionally
	relevant divergence between groups of species. Moreover, it could
	also be useful to detect artifacts in automatically assembled genomes.}},

	substitutions that change codons from preferred to unpreferred or
	vice versa as nonconservative synonymous substitutions and all other
	substitutions as conservative. Using a maximum-likelihood framework,
	we then test whether conservative and nonconservative synonymous
	substitutions occur at equal rates. Our approach replaces the standard
	rate of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, dS, with two
	new rates, the conservative synonymous substitution rate (dS(C))
	and the nonconservative synonymous substitution rate (dS(N)). Based
	on the ratio dS(N)/dS(C), we find that 0.05\% of all yeast genes
	and none of worm genes show evidence of positive selection at synonymous
	sites (dS(N)/dS(C) > 1). On the other hand, 9.44\% of all yeast genes
	and 5.12\% of all worm genes show evidence of significant purifying
	selection on synonymous sites (dS(N)/dS(C) < 1). We also find that
	dS(N) correlates strongly with gene expression level, whereas the
	correlation between expression level and dS(C) is very weak. Thus,
	dS(N) captures most of the signal of selection for translational
	accuracy and speed, whereas dS(C) is not strongly influenced by this
	selection pressure. We suggest that the ratio dN/dS(C) may be more
	appropriate than the ratio dN/dS to identify positive or purifying
