	dispersal parameter of a Brownian motion defined on coalescent trees.
	First, we consider the mean square distance unbiased estimator and
	compute its variance. In a second approach, we introduce a phylogenetic
	estimator. Given the UPGMA topology, the likelihood of the parameter
	is computed thanks to a new dynamical programming method. By a proper
	correction, an unbiased estimator is derived from the pseudomaximum
	of the likelihood. The last approach consists of computing the likelihood
	by a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method. In the one-dimensional
	Brownian motion, this method seems less reliable than pseudomaximum-likelihood.},

  abstract = {Varroa destructor is a parasitic mite of the Eastern honeybee Apis
	cerana. Fifty years ago, two distinct evolutionary lineages (Korean
	and Japanese) invaded the Western honeybee Apis mellifera. This haplo-diploid
	parasite species reproduces mainly through brother-sister matings,
	a system which largely favors the fixation of new mutations. In a
	worldwide sample of 225 individuals from 21 locations collected on
	Western honeybees and analyzed at 19 microsatellite loci, a series
	of de novo mutations was observed. Using historical data concerning
	the invasion, this original biological system has been exploited
	to compare three mutation models with allele size constraints for
	microsatellite markers: stepwise (SMM) and generalized (GSM) mutation
	models, and a model with mutation rate increasing exponentially with
	microsatellite length (ESM). Posterior probabilities of the three
	models have been estimated for each locus individually using reversible
	jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The relative support of each model
	varies widely among loci, but the GSM is the only model that always
	receives at least 9\% support, whatever the locus. The analysis also
	provides robust estimates of mutation parameters for each locus and
	of the divergence time of the two invasive lineages (67,000 generations
	with a 90\% credibility interval of 35,000-174,000). With an average
	of 10 generations per year, this divergence time fits with the last
	post-glacial Korea-Japan land separation.},

  abstract = {In phylogenetics, the unrooted model of phylogeny and the strict molecular
	clock model are two extremes of a continuum. Despite their dominance
	in phylogenetic inference, it is evident that both are biologically
	unrealistic and that the real evolutionary process lies between these
	two extremes. Fortunately, intermediate models employing relaxed
	molecular clocks have been described. These models open the gate
	to a new field of "relaxed phylogenetics." Here we introduce a new
	approach to performing relaxed phylogenetic analysis. We describe
	how it can be used to estimate phylogenies and divergence times in
	the face of uncertainty in evolutionary rates and calibration times.
	Our approach also provides a means for measuring the clocklikeness
	of datasets and comparing this measure between different genes and
	phylogenies. We find no significant rate autocorrelation among branches
	in three large datasets, suggesting that autocorrelated models are
	not necessarily suitable for these data. In addition, we place these
	datasets on the continuum of clocklikeness between a strict molecular
	clock and the alternative unrooted extreme. Finally, we present analyses
	of 102 bacterial, 106 yeast, 61 plant, 99 metazoan, and 500 primate
	alignments. From these we conclude that our method is phylogenetically
	more accurate and precise than the traditional unrooted model while
	adding the ability to infer a timescale to evolution.},

	A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Bayesian statistical approach is
	used to calculate the posterior probability distribution of population
	parameters of interest, including the effective population size and
	the time to most recent common ancestor (MRCA). To test whether two
	populations are homogeneously mixed we introduce a "mixing" statistic
	defined for each coalescent event that weights the contribution of
	that ancestor's descendants to the two subpopulations, and an associated
	population "purity" statistic. Using simulated data with low levels
	of migration between two populations, we demonstrate that our method
	is more sensitive than other commonly used distance-based methods
	such as R(ST) and D(SW). To illustrate our method, we analysed mixing
	between 11 pre-defined Chinese ethnic/regional populations, using
	5 microsatellite markers from the non-recombining region of the Y-chromosome
	(NRY), demonstrating a significant clustering of a subset of subpopulations
	with a high mutual relative degree of mixing (homogeneous mixing
	with support >0.99). Our analysis suggests that there is a strong
	correlation between effective population size and mixing with other
	subpopulations. Thus, despite considerable mixing between these groups,
	the purity statistic still identifies significant heterogeneity,
	suggesting that periods of historical isolation continue to leave
	a recoverable signal despite modern introgression.},

  title = {Bayesian coestimation of phylogeny and sequence alignment.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {83},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two central problems in computational biology are the
	determination of the alignment and phylogeny of a set of biological
	sequences. The traditional approach to this problem is to first build
	a multiple alignment of these sequences, followed by a phylogenetic
	reconstruction step based on this multiple alignment. However, alignment
	and phylogenetic inference are fundamentally interdependent, and
	ignoring this fact leads to biased and overconfident estimations.
	Whether the main interest be in sequence alignment or phylogeny,
	a major goal of computational biology is the co-estimation of both.
	RESULTS: We developed a fully Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method
	for coestimating phylogeny and sequence alignment, under the Thorne-Kishino-Felsenstein
	model of substitution and single nucleotide insertion-deletion (indel)
	events. In our earlier work, we introduced a novel and efficient
	algorithm, termed the "indel peeling algorithm", which includes indels
	as phylogenetically informative evolutionary events, and resembles
	Felsenstein's peeling algorithm for substitutions on a phylogenetic
	tree. For a fixed alignment, our extension analytically integrates
	out both substitution and indel events within a proper statistical
	model, without the need for data augmentation at internal tree nodes,
	allowing for efficient sampling of tree topologies and edge lengths.
	To additionally sample multiple alignments, we here introduce an
	efficient partial Metropolized independence sampler for alignments,
	and combine these two algorithms into a fully Bayesian co-estimation
	procedure for the alignment and phylogeny problem. Our approach results
	in estimates for the posterior distribution of evolutionary rate
	parameters, for the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) phylogenetic tree,
	and for the posterior decoding alignment. Estimates for the evolutionary
	tree and multiple alignment are augmented with confidence estimates
	for each node height and alignment column. Our results indicate that
	the patterns in reliability broadly correspond to structural features
	of the proteins, and thus provides biologically meaningful information
	which is not existent in the usual point-estimate of the alignment.
	Our methods can handle input data of moderate size (10-20 protein
	sequences, each 100-200 bp), which we analyzed overnight on a standard
	2 GHz personal computer. CONCLUSION: Joint analysis of multiple sequence
	alignment, evolutionary trees and additional evolutionary parameters
	can be now done within a single coherent statistical framework.},

	are a mutation rate and either the dispersal rate in a stepping stone
	model or a dispersal rate and a scale parameter in a geometric dispersal
	model. An approximate procedure known as maximum product of approximate
	conditional (PAC) likelihood is found to perform as well as ML. Mis-specification
	biases may occur because the importance sampling algorithm is formally
	defined in term of mutation and migration rates scaled by the total
	size of the population, and this size may differ widely in the statistical
	model and in reality. As could be expected, ML generally performs
	well when the statistical model is correctly specified. Otherwise,
	mutation rate estimates are much closer to mutation probability scaled
	by number of demes in the statistical model than scaled by number
	of demes in reality when mutation probability is high and dispersal
	is most limited. This mis-specification bias actually has practical
	benefits. However, opposite results are found in opposite conditions.
	Migration rate estimates show roughly similar trends, but they may
	not always be easily interpreted as low-bias estimates of dispersal
	rate under any scaling. Estimation of the dispersal scale parameter
	is also affected by mis-specification of the number of demes, and
	the different biases compensate each other in such a way that good
	estimation of the so-called neighborhood size (or more precisely
	the product of population density and mean-squared parent-offspring
	dispersal distance) is achieved. Results congruent with these findings

  abstract = {For an admixed population, an important question is how much genetic
	contribution comes from each parental population. Several methods
	have been developed to estimate such admixture proportions, using
	data on genetic markers sampled from parental and admixed populations.
	In this study, I propose a likelihood method to estimate jointly
	the admixture proportions, the genetic drift that occurred to the
	admixed population and each parental population during the period
	between the hybridization and sampling events, and the genetic drift
	in each ancestral population within the interval between their split
	and hybridization. The results from extensive simulations using various
	combinations of relevant parameter values show that in general much
	more accurate and precise estimates of admixture proportions are
	obtained from the likelihood method than from previous methods. The
	likelihood method also yields reasonable estimates of genetic drift
	that occurred to each population, which translate into relative effective
	sizes (N(e)) or absolute average N(e)'s if the times when the relevant
	events (such as population split, admixture, and sampling) occurred
	are known. The proposed likelihood method also has features such
	as relatively low computational requirement compared with previous
	ones, flexibility for admixture models, and marker types. In particular,
	it allows for missing data from a contributing parental population.
	The method is applied to a human data set and a wolflike canids data
	set, and the results obtained are discussed in comparison with those
	from other estimators and from previous studies.},

  abstract = {In the past, moment and likelihood methods have been developed to
	estimate the effective population size (N(e)) on the basis of the
	observed changes of marker allele frequencies over time, and these
	have been applied to a large variety of species and populations.
	Such methods invariably make the critical assumption of a single
	isolated population receiving no immigrants over the study interval.
	For most populations in the real world, however, migration is not
	negligible and can substantially bias estimates of N(e) if it is
	not accounted for. Here we extend previous moment and maximum-likelihood
	methods to allow the joint estimation of N(e) and migration rate
	(m) using genetic samples over space and time. It is shown that,
	compared to genetic drift acting alone, migration results in changes
	in allele frequency that are greater in the short term and smaller
	in the long term, leading to under- and overestimation of N(e), respectively,
	if it is ignored. Extensive simulations are run to evaluate the newly
	developed moment and likelihood methods, which yield generally satisfactory
	estimates of both N(e) and m for populations with widely different
	effective sizes and migration rates and patterns, given a reasonably
	large sample size and number of markers.},

	the generating function. The impact of the differing choice of models
	is examined using likelihood estimates for time to most recent common

  abstract = {Ease and accuracy of typing, together with high levels of polymorphism
	and widespread distribution in the genome, make microsatellite (or
	short tandem repeat) loci an attractive potential source of information
	about both population histories and evolutionary processes. However,
	microsatellite data are difficult to interpret, in particular because
	of the frequency of back-mutations. Stochastic models for the underlying
	genetic processes can be specified, but in the past they have been
	too complicated for direct analysis. Recent developments in stochastic
	simulation methodology now allow direct inference about both historical
	events, such as genealogical coalescence times, and evolutionary
	parameters, such as mutation rates. A feature of the Markov chain
	Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that we propose here is that the likelihood
	computations are simplified by treating the (unknown) ancestral allelic
	states as auxiliary parameters. We illustrate the algorithm by analyzing
	microsatellite samples simulated under the model. Our results suggest
	that a single microsatellite usually does not provide enough information
	for useful inferences, but that several completely linked microsatellites
	can be informative about some aspects of genealogical history and
	evolutionary processes. We also reanalyze data from a previously
	published human Y chromosome microsatellite study, finding evidence
	for an effective population size for human Y chromosomes in the low
	thousands and a recent time since their most recent common ancestor:
	the 95\% interval runs from approximately 15, 000 to 130,000 years,
	with most likely values around 30,000 years.},
