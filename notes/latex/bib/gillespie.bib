  abstract = {The results of a computer simulation study of the role of population
	size in population genetical models of molecular evolution are presented.
	If the mutation rate and strength of selection are held fixed and
	the population size increased, the eight models examined fall into
	three domains based on their rates of substitution. In the Ohta domain,
	the rate of substitution decreases with increasing population size;
	in the Kimura domain, the rate of substitution remains close to the
	mutation rate; in the Darwin domain, the rate of substitution increases
	without bound. In the Kimura and Darwin domains, the rate of substitution
	is much less sensitive to the population size than suggested by two-allele
	theories. Remarkably, the overdominance model converges to the neutral
	model with increasing N. The variation at a neutral locus linked
	to a selected locus is found to be insensitive to the population
	size for certain models of selection. A selected locus can actually
	cause the rate of substitution of deleterious alleles at a linked
	locus to increase with increasing population size. These unexpected
	results illustrate that intuition based on two-allele theory is often
	misleading.},
