  abstract = {The BLAST programs are widely used tools for searching protein and
	DNA databases for sequence similarities. For protein comparisons,
	a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements
	described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to
	be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak
	similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word
	hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments,
	yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times
	the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for
	automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced
	by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the
	database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated
	BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per
	iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive
	to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST
	is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT
	superfamily.},

  abstract = {The coalescent process can describe the effects of selection at linked
	loci only if selection is so strong that genotype frequencies evolve
	deterministically. Here, we develop methods proposed by Kaplan, Darden,
	and Hudson to find the effects of weak selection. We show that the
	overall effect is given by an extension to Price's equation: the
	change in properties such as moments of coalescence times is equal
	to the covariance between those properties and the fitness of the
	sample of genes. The distribution of coalescence times differs substantially
	between allelic classes, even in the absence of selection. However,
	the average coalescence time between randomly chosen genes is insensitive
	to the current allele frequency and is affected significantly by
	purifying selection only if deleterious mutations are common and
	selection is strong (i.e., the product of population size and selection
	coefficient, Ns>3). Balancing selection increases mean coalescence
	times, but the effect becomes large only when mutation rates between
	allelic classes are low and when selection is extremely strong. Our
	analysis supports previous simulations that show that selection has
	surprisingly little effect on genealogies. Moreover, small fluctuations
	in allele frequency due to random drift can greatly reduce any such
	effects. This will make it difficult to detect the action of selection
	from neutral variation alone.},

  year = {2004},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {42},
  number = {1},
  month = {Oct},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The regulation of a gene depends on the binding of transcription
	factors to specific sites located in the regulatory region of the
	gene. The generation of these binding sites and of cooperativity
	between them are essential building blocks in the evolution of complex
	regulatory networks. We study a theoretical model for the sequence
	evolution of binding sites by point mutations. The approach is based
	on biophysical models for the binding of transcription factors to
	DNA. Hence we derive empirically grounded fitness landscapes, which
	enter a population genetics model including mutations, genetic drift,
	and selection. RESULTS: We show that the selection for factor binding
	generically leads to specific correlations between nucleotide frequencies
	at different positions of a binding site. We demonstrate the possibility
	of rapid adaptive evolution generating a new binding site for a given
	transcription factor by point mutations. The evolutionary time required
	is estimated in terms of the neutral (background) mutation rate,
	the selection coefficient, and the effective population size. CONCLUSIONS:
	The efficiency of binding site formation is seen to depend on two
	joint conditions: the binding site motif must be short enough and
	the promoter region must be long enough. These constraints on promoter
	architecture are indeed seen in eukaryotic systems. Furthermore,
	we analyse the adaptive evolution of genetic switches and of signal
	integration through binding cooperativity between different sites.
	Experimental tests of this picture involving the statistics of polymorphisms
	and phylogenies of sites are discussed.},

	genetic variants in susceptibility to common diseases. This will
	require characterizing the nature of gene variation in human populations,
	assembling an extensive catalogue of single-nucleotide polymorphisms
	(SNPs) in candidate genes and performing association studies for
	particular diseases. At present, our knowledge of human gene variation
	remains rudimentary. Here we describe a systematic survey of SNPs
	in the coding regions of human genes. We identified SNPs in 106 genes
	relevant to cardiovascular disease, endocrinology and neuropsychiatry
	by screening an average of 114 independent alleles using 2 independent
	screening methods. To ensure high accuracy, all reported SNPs were
	confirmed by DNA sequencing. We identified 560 SNPs, including 392
	coding-region SNPs (cSNPs) divided roughly equally between those
	causing synonymous and non-synonymous changes. We observed different
	rates of polymorphism among classes of sites within genes (non-coding,
	degenerate and non-degenerate) as well as between genes. The cSNPs
	most likely to influence disease, those that alter the amino acid
	sequence of the encoded protein, are found at a lower rate and with
	lower allele frequencies than silent substitutions. This likely reflects
	selection acting against deleterious alleles during human evolution.
	The lower allele frequency of missense cSNPs has implications for
	the compilation of a comprehensive catalogue, as well as for the
	subsequent application to disease association.},

	structural and mapping information has been accomplished through
	bi-directional links between HGMD and both the Genome Database (GDB)
	and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), Baltimore, USA. Hypertext
	links have also been established to Medline abstracts through Entrez

	comparison of the A/S ratio of polymorphism in Drosophila melanogaster

	Here we show that the difference between polymorphism and divergence

	A higher A/S ratio of divergence than of polymorphism is also observed

	have developed LS-SNP, a genomic scale software pipeline to annotate
	nsSNPs. LS-SNP comprehensively maps nsSNPs onto protein sequences,
	functional pathways and comparative protein structure models, and
	predicts positions where nsSNPs destabilize proteins, interfere with
	the formation of domain-domain interfaces, have an effect on protein-ligand
	binding or severely impact human health. It currently annotates 28,043
	validated SNPs that produce amino acid residue substitutions in human
	proteins from the SwissProt/TrEMBL database. Annotations can be viewed
	via a web interface either in the context of a genomic region or
	by selecting sets of SNPs, genes, proteins or pathways. These results
	are useful for identifying candidate functional SNPs within a gene,

  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {326},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of protein design is to predict amino-acid sequences
	compatible with a given target structure. Traditionally envisioned
	as a purely thermodynamic question, this problem can also be understood
	in a wider context, where additional constraints are captured by
	learning the sequence patterns displayed by natural proteins of known
	conformation. In this latter perspective, however, we still need
	a theoretical formalization of the question, leading to general and
	efficient learning methods, and allowing for the selection of fast
	and accurate objective functions quantifying sequence/structure compatibility.
	RESULTS: We propose a formulation of the protein design problem in
	terms of model-based statistical inference. Our framework uses the
	maximum likelihood principle to optimize the unknown parameters of
	a statistical potential, which we call an inverse potential to contrast
	with classical potentials used for structure prediction. We propose
	an implementation based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, in which the
	likelihood is maximized by gradient descent and is numerically estimated
	by thermodynamic integration. The fit of the models is evaluated
	by cross-validation. We apply this to a simple pairwise contact potential,
	supplemented with a solvent-accessibility term, and show that the
	resulting models have a better predictive power than currently available
	pairwise potentials. Furthermore, the model comparison method presented
	here allows one to measure the relative contribution of each component
	of the potential, and to choose the optimal number of accessibility
	classes, which turns out to be much higher than classically considered.
	CONCLUSION: Altogether, this reformulation makes it possible to test
	a wide diversity of models, using different forms of potentials,
	or accounting for other factors than just the constraint of thermodynamic
	stability. Ultimately, such model-based statistical analyses may
	help to understand the forces shaping protein sequences, and driving
	their evolution.},

  abstract = {All inferences in comparative biology depend on accurate estimates
	of evolutionary relationships. Recent phylogenetic analyses have
	turned away from maximum parsimony towards the probabilistic techniques
	of maximum likelihood and bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC).
	These probabilistic techniques represent a parametric approach to
	statistical phylogenetics, because their criterion for evaluating
	a topology--the probability of the data, given the tree--is calculated
	with reference to an explicit evolutionary model from which the data
	are assumed to be identically distributed. Maximum parsimony can
	be considered nonparametric, because trees are evaluated on the basis
	of a general metric--the minimum number of character state changes
	required to generate the data on a given tree--without assuming a
	specific distribution. The shift to parametric methods was spurred,
	in large part, by studies showing that although both approaches perform
	well most of the time, maximum parsimony is strongly biased towards
	recovering an incorrect tree under certain combinations of branch
	lengths, whereas maximum likelihood is not. All these evaluations
	simulated sequences by a largely homogeneous evolutionary process
	in which data are identically distributed. There is ample evidence,
	however, that real-world gene sequences evolve heterogeneously and
	are not identically distributed. Here we show that maximum likelihood
	and BMCMC can become strongly biased and statistically inconsistent
	when the rates at which sequence sites evolve change non-identically
	over time. Maximum parsimony performs substantially better than current
	parametric methods over a wide range of conditions tested, including
	moderate heterogeneity and phylogenetic problems not normally considered

	Each gene corresponds to a single locus at which there is no recombination.
	The genealogy of the sample is embedded in a graph which we call
	the ancestral selection graph. This graph contains all the information
	about the ancestry; it is the analogue of Kingman's coalescent process
	which arises in the case with no selection. The ancestral selection
	graph can be easily simulated and we outline an algorithm for simulating
	samples. The main goal is to analyze the ancestral selection graph
	and to compare it to Kingman's coalescent process. In the case of
	no mutation, we find that the distribution of the time to the most
	recent common ancestor does not depend on the selection coefficient
	and hence is the same as in the neutral case. When the mutation rate
	is positive, we give a procedure for computing the probability that
	two individuals in a sample are identical by descent and the Laplace
	transform of the time to the most recent common ancestor of a sample
	of two individuals; we evaluate the first two terms of their respective
	power series in terms of the selection coefficient. The probability
	of identity by descent depends on both the selection coefficient
	and the mutation rate and is different from the analogous expression
	in the neutral case. The Laplace transform does not have a linear
	correction term in the selection coefficient. We also provide a recursion
	formula that can be used to approximate the probability of a given
	sample by simulating backwards along the sample paths of the ancestral

	an alternation between data augmentation and Gibbs sampling. The
	data augmentation step consists in sampling a detailed substitution
	history for each site, and across the whole tree, given the current
	value of the model parameters. Provided convenient priors are used,
	the parameters of the model can then be directly updated by a Gibbs
	sampling procedure, conditional on the current substitution history.
	Alternating between these two sampling steps yields a MCMC device
	whose equilibrium distribution is the posterior probability density
	of interest. We show, on real examples, that this conjugate Gibbs
	method leads to a significant improvement of the mixing behavior
	of the MCMC. In all cases, the decorrelation times of the resulting
	chains are smaller than those obtained by standard Metropolis Hastings
	procedures by at least one order of magnitude. The method is particularly
	well suited to heterogeneous models, i.e. assuming site-specific
	random variables. In particular, the conjugate Gibbs formalism allows

  abstract = {One of the most abiding controversies in evolutionary biology concerns
	the role of neutral processes in molecular evolution. A main focus
	of the debate has been the evolution of isochores, the strong and
	systematic variation of base composition in mammalian genomes. One
	set of hypotheses argue that regions of similar GC are owing to localised
	mutational biases coupled with neutral evolution. The alternatives
	point to either selection or biased gene conversion as mechanisms
	to preferentially remove A or T bases, favouring G and C instead.
	Using a novel method, we compare models including such fixation biases
	to models based on mutation bias alone, under the assumption that
	non-coding, non-repetitive human DNA is at compositional equilibrium.
	While failing to fully explain the allele frequency distributions
	of recent single nucleotide polymorphism data, we show that the data
	are best fitted if the mutation bias is assumed to be constant across
	the genome, while fixation bias varies with GC content. We also attempt
	to estimate the strength of fixation bias, which increases linearly
	with increasing GC. Our approximation suggests that this force exists
	within the necessary parameter range: it is not so weak as to be
	drowned by random drift, but not so strong as to lead to exclusive
	use of G and C alone. Together these results demonstrate that mutation
	bias fails to explain the evolution of isochores, and suggest that

	approximations of Bayes factors, which we find to be accurate and

  abstract = {In recent works, methods have been proposed for applying phylogenetic
	models that allow for a general interdependence between the amino
	acid positions of a protein. As of yet, such models have focused
	on site interdependencies resulting from sequence-structure compatibility
	constraints, using simplified structural representations in combination
	with a set of statistical potentials. This structural compatibility
	criterion is meant as a proxy for sequence fitness, and the methods
	developed thus far can incorporate different site-interdependent
	fitness proxies based on other measurements. However, no methods
	have been proposed for comparing and evaluating the adequacy of alternative
	fitness proxies in this context, or for more general comparisons
	with canonical models of protein evolution. In the present work,
	we apply Bayesian methods of model selection-based on numerical calculations
	of marginal likelihoods and posterior predictive checks-to evaluate
	models encompassing the site-interdependent framework. Our application
	of these methods indicates that considering site-interdependencies,
	as done here, leads to an improved model fit for all data sets studied.
	Yet, we find that the use of pairwise contact potentials alone does
	not suitably account for across-site rate heterogeneity or amino
	acid exchange propensities; for such complexities, site-independent
	treatments are still called for. The most favored models combine
	the use of statistical potentials with a suitably rich site-independent
	model. Altogether, the methodology employed here should allow for
	a more rigorous and systematic exploration of different ways of modeling
	explicit structural constraints, or any other site-interdependent
	criterion, while best exploiting the richness of previously proposed
	models.},

	as proteins with similar three-dimensional structures (same SCOP
	fold classification) but generally with different functions and little
	evidence of a common ancestor (different SCOP superfamily classification).
	Homologues were defined as pairs of similar structures likely to
	be the result of evolutionary divergence (same superfamily) and were
	divided into remote, medium and close sub-divisions based on the
	percentage sequence identity. Particular attention was paid to the
	differences between analogues and remote homologues, since both types
	of similarities are generally undetectable by sequence comparison
	and their detection is the aim of fold recognition methods. Distributions
	of sequence identities and substitution matrices suggest a higher
	degree of sequence similarity in remote homologues than in analogues.
	Matrices for remote homologues show similarity to existing mutation
	matrices, providing some validity for their use in previously described
	fold recognition methods. In contrast, matrices derived from analogous
	proteins show little conservation of amino acid properties beyond
	broad conservation of hydrophobic or polar character. Secondary structure
	and accessibility were more conserved on average in remote homologues
	than in analogues, though there was no apparent difference in the
	root-mean-square deviation between these two types of similarities.
	Alignments of remote homologues and analogues show a similar number
	of gaps, openings (one or more sequential gaps) and inserted/deleted
	secondary structure elements, and both generally contain more gaps/openings/deleted
	secondary structure elements than medium and close homologues. These
	results suggest that gap parameters for fold recognition should be
	more lenient than those used in sequence comparison. Parameters were
	derived from the analogue and remote homologue datasets for potential
	used in fold recognition methods. Implications for protein fold recognition

	Previous studies have suggested that CCR5-Delta32 arose within the
	past 1,000 y and rose to its present high frequency (5\%-14\%) in
	Europe as a result of strong positive selection, perhaps by such
	selective agents as the bubonic plague or smallpox during the Middle
	Ages. This hypothesis was based on several lines of evidence, including
	the absence of the allele outside of Europe and long-range linkage
	disequilibrium at the locus. We reevaluated this evidence with the
	benefit of much denser genetic maps and extensive control data. We
	find that the pattern of genetic variation at CCR5-Delta32 does not
	stand out as exceptional relative to other loci across the genome.
	Moreover using newer genetic maps, we estimated that the CCR5-Delta32
	allele is likely to have arisen more than 5,000 y ago. While such
	results can not rule out the possibility that some selection may
	have occurred at C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), they imply that
	the pattern of genetic variation seen at CCR5-Delta32 is consistent
	with neutral evolution. More broadly, the results have general implications

	two criteria for inferring the optimal tree topology from data sets

	sets where gene-specific evolutionary features are too important
	to ignore. One criterion is conventional and is obtained by taking
	the sum of log-likelihoods over all genes. The other criterion is
	obtained by dividing the log-likelihood for a gene by its sequence

	A similar strategy could be adopted with parsimony scores. The optimal

	mean is maximized. These criteria are justified within a two-stage
	hierarchical framework. The first level of the hierarchy represents
	gene-specific evolutionary features, and the second represents site-specific
	features for given genes. For testing significance of the optimal

	times to the most recent common ancestor of samples of n genes under
	recombination and selection in two-locus, two-allele haploid and
	diploid models are presented. Such times are conditional on sample
	configuration. Monte Carlo simulations show that 'hitch-hiking' is
	a subtle effect that alters the conditional expected depth of the
	genealogy at the linked neutral locus depending on a mutation-selection-recombination

  abstract = {In humans, the rate of recombination, as measured on the megabase
	scale, is positively associated with the level of genetic variation,
	as measured at the genic scale. Despite considerable debate, it is
	not clear whether these factors are causally linked or, if they are,
	whether this is driven by the repeated action of adaptive evolution
	or molecular processes such as double-strand break formation and
	mismatch repair. We introduce three innovations to the analysis of
	recombination and diversity: fine-scale genetic maps estimated from
	genotype experiments that identify recombination hotspots at the
	kilobase scale, analysis of an entire human chromosome, and the use
	of wavelet techniques to identify correlations acting at different
	scales. We show that recombination influences genetic diversity only
	at the level of recombination hotspots. Hotspots are also associated
	with local increases in GC content and the relative frequency of
	GC-increasing mutations but have no effect on substitution rates.
	Broad-scale association between recombination and diversity is explained
	through covariance of both factors with base composition. To our
	knowledge, these results are the first evidence of a direct and local
	influence of recombination hotspots on genetic variation and the
	fate of individual mutations. However, that hotspots have no influence
	on substitution rates suggests that they are too ephemeral on an
	evolutionary time scale to have a strong influence on broader scale
	patterns of base composition and long-term molecular evolution.},

	shown to be usually conserved and typically the largest contact in

	and encodings of this information is used to answer the following
	questions: (1) is a given crystal contact biological, and (2) given
	all crystal contacts in a homodimer, which is the biological one?
	Predictions for (1) are performed on both homodimer and monomer datasets.
	The best performing neural network combined size and conservation
	inputs. For the homodimers, it correctly classified 48 out of 53
	biological contacts and 364 out of 366 non-biological contacts, giving
	a combined accuracy of 98.3 \%. A more robust performance statistic,

  abstract = {The phylogenetic inference of ancestral protein sequences is a powerful

	method. Every inference method leads to errors in the ancestral protein
	sequence, resulting in potentially misleading estimates of the ancestral

	reconstruction methods, we performed computational population evolution
	simulations featuring near-neutral evolution under purifying selection,
	speciation, and divergence using an off-lattice protein model where
	fitness depends on the ability to be stable in a specified target
	structure. We were thus able to compare the thermodynamic properties
	of the true ancestral sequences with the properties of "ancestral
	sequences" inferred by maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and
	Bayesian methods. Surprisingly, we found that methods such as maximum
	parsimony and maximum likelihood that reconstruct a "best guess"
	amino acid at each position overestimate thermostability, while a
	Bayesian method that sometimes chooses less-probable residues from
	the posterior probability distribution does not. Maximum likelihood
	and maximum parsimony apparently tend to eliminate variants at a
	position that are slightly detrimental to structural stability simply
	because such detrimental variants are less frequent. Other properties
	of ancestral proteins might be similarly overestimated. This suggests

	was the best reconstruction at the site. The lysozyme c sequences
	of six mammals were analyzed by using the likelihood and parsimony
	methods. The new likelihood-based method was found to be superior
	to the parsimony method. The probability that the amino acids for
	all interior nodes at a site reconstructed by the new method are
	correct was calculated to be 0.91, 0.86, and 0.73 for all, variable,
	and parsimony-informative sites, respectively, whereas the corresponding
	probabilities for the parsimony method were 0.84, 0.76, and 0.51,
	respectively. The probability that an amino acid in an ancestral
	sequence is correctly reconstructed by the likelihood analysis ranged
	from 91.3 to 98.7\% for the four ancestral sequences.},

  abstract = {The most common cause of monogenic disease is a single base DNA variant
	resulting in an amino acid substitution. In a previous study, we
	observed that a high fraction of these substitutions appear to result
	in reduction of stability of the corresponding protein structure.
	We have now investigated this phenomenon more fully. A set of structural
	effects, such as reduction in hydrophobic area, overpacking, backbone
	strain, and loss of electrostatic interactions, is used to represent
	the impact of single residue mutations on protein stability. A support
	vector machine (SVM) was trained on a set of mutations causative
	of disease, and a control set of non-disease causing mutations. In
	jack-knifed testing, the method identifies 74\% of disease mutations,
	with a false positive rate of 15\%. Evaluation of a set of in vitro
	mutagenesis data with the SVM established that the majority of disease
	mutations affect protein stability by 1 to 3 kcal/mol. The method's
	effective distinction between disease and non-disease variants, strongly
	supports the hypothesis that loss of protein stability is a major
	factor contributing to monogenic disease.},

  year = {2006},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The relationship between disease susceptibility and genetic
	variation is complex, and many different types of data are relevant.
	We describe a web resource and database that provides and integrates
	as much information as possible on disease/gene relationships at
	the molecular level. DESCRIPTION: The resource http://www.SNPs3D.org
	has three primary modules. One module identifies which genes are
	candidates for involvement in a specified disease. A second module
	provides information about the relationships between sets of candidate
	genes. The third module analyzes the likely impact of non-synonymous
	SNPs on protein function. Disease/candidate gene relationships and
	gene-gene relationships are derived from the literature using simple
	but effective text profiling. SNP/protein function relationships
	are derived by two methods, one using principles of protein structure
	and stability, the other based on sequence conservation. Entries
	for each gene include a number of links to other data, such as expression
	profiles, pathway context, mouse knockout information and papers.
	Gene-gene interactions are presented in an interactive graphical
	interface, providing rapid access to the underlying information,
	as well as convenient navigation through the network. Use of the
	resource is illustrated with aspects of the inflammatory response
	and hypertension. CONCLUSION: The combination of SNP impact analysis,
	a knowledge based network of gene relationships and candidate genes,
	and access to a wide range of data and literature allow a user to
	quickly assimilate available information, and so develop models of
	gene-pathway-disease interaction.},

	within a protein family. A machine learning technique, the support
	vector machine, is trained on single amino acid changes that cause
	monogenic disease, with a control set of amino acid changes fixed

	nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human population. After carefully
	controlling for errors, we find that approximately one quarter of
	known non-synonymous SNPs are deleterious by these criteria, providing
	a set of possible contributors to human complex disease traits.},

  abstract = {By comparing the low-, intermediate-, and high-frequency parts of
	the frequency spectrum, we gain information on the evolutionary forces

	We emphasize the high-frequency variants on which positive selection
	and negative (background) selection exhibit different effects. We
	propose a new estimator of theta (the product of effective population
	size and neutral mutation rate), thetaL, which is sensitive to the
	changes in high-frequency variants. The new thetaL allows us to revise
	Fay and Wu's H-test by normalization. To complement the existing
	statistics (the H-test and Tajima's D-test), we propose a new test,
	E, which relies on the difference between thetaL and Watterson's
	thetaW. We show that this test is most powerful in detecting the
	recovery phase after the loss of genetic diversity, which includes
	the postselective sweep phase. The sensitivities of these tests to
	(or robustness against) background selection and demographic changes
	are also considered. Overall, D and H in combination can be most
	effective in detecting positive selection while being insensitive
	to other perturbations. We thus propose a joint test, referred to
	as the DH test. Simulations indicate that DH is indeed sensitive
	primarily to directional selection and no other driving forces.},
