  abstract = {We present GSR, a probabilistic model integrating gene duplication,
	sequence evolution, and a relaxed molecular clock for substitution
	rates, that enables genomewide analysis of gene families. The gene
	duplication and loss process is a major cause for incongruence between
	gene and species tree, and deterministic methods have been developed
	to explain such differences through tree reconciliations. Although
	probabilistic methods for phylogenetic inference have been around
	for decades, probabilistic reconciliation methods are far less established.
	Based on our model, we have implemented a Bayesian analysis tool,
	PrIME-GSR, for gene tree inference that takes a known species tree
	into account. Our implementation is sound and we demonstrate its
	utility for genomewide gene-family analysis by applying it to recently
	presented yeast data. We validate PrIME-GSR by comparing with previous
	analyses of these data that take advantage of gene order information.
	In a case study we apply our method to the ADH gene family and are
	able to draw biologically relevant conclusions concerning gene duplications
	creating key yeast phenotypes. On a higher level this shows the biological
	relevance of our method. The obtained results demonstrate the value
	of a relaxed molecular clock. Our good performance will extend to
	species where gene order conservation is insufficient.},

	for (MC)(3). The proposed parallel algorithm retains the ability
	to explore multiple peaks in the posterior distribution of trees
	while maintaining a fast execution time. The algorithm has been implemented
	using two popular parallel programming models: message passing and
	shared memory. Performance results indicate nearly linear speed improvement

  abstract = {Multigene sequence data have great potential for elucidating important
	and interesting evolutionary processes, but statistical methods for
	extracting information from such data remain limited. Although various
	biological processes may cause different genes to have different
	genealogical histories (and hence different tree topologies), we
	also may expect that the number of distinct topologies among a set
	of genes is relatively small compared with the number of possible
	topologies. Therefore evidence about the tree topology for one gene
	should influence our inferences of the tree topology on a different
	gene, but to what extent? In this paper, we present a new approach
	for modeling and estimating concordance among a set of gene trees
	given aligned molecular sequence data. Our approach introduces a
	one-parameter probability distribution to describe the prior distribution
	of concordance among gene trees. We describe a novel 2-stage Markov
	chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that first obtains independent Bayesian
	posterior probability distributions for individual genes using standard
	methods. These posterior distributions are then used as input for
	a second MCMC procedure that estimates a posterior distribution of
	gene-to-tree maps (GTMs). The posterior distribution of GTMs can
	then be summarized to provide revised posterior probability distributions
	for each gene (taking account of concordance) and to allow estimation
	of the proportion of the sampled genes for which any given clade
	is true (the sample-wide concordance factor). Further, under the
	assumption that the sampled genes are drawn randomly from a genome
	of known size, we show how one can obtain an estimate, with credibility
	intervals, on the proportion of the entire genome for which a clade
	is true (the genome-wide concordance factor). We demonstrate the
	method on a set of 106 genes from 8 yeast species.},

  title = {Phylogenetic identification of lateral genetic transfer events.},
  journal = {BMC Evol Biol},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {15},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lateral genetic transfer can lead to disagreements among
	phylogenetic trees comprising sequences from the same set of taxa.
	Where topological discordance is thought to have arisen through genetic
	transfer events, tree comparisons can be used to identify the lineages
	that may have shared genetic information. An 'edit path' of one or
	more transfer events can be represented with a series of subtree
	prune and regraft (SPR) operations, but finding the optimal such
	set of operations is NP-hard for comparisons between rooted trees,
	and may be so for unrooted trees as well. RESULTS: Efficient Evaluation
	of Edit Paths (EEEP) is a new tree comparison algorithm that uses
	evolutionarily reasonable constraints to identify and eliminate many
	unproductive search avenues, reducing the time required to solve
	many edit path problems. The performance of EEEP compares favourably
	to that of other algorithms when applied to strictly bifurcating
	trees with specified numbers of SPR operations. We also used EEEP
	to recover edit paths from over 19,000 unrooted, incompletely resolved
	protein trees containing up to 144 taxa as part of a large phylogenomic
	study. While inferred protein trees were far more similar to a reference
	supertree than random trees were to each other, the phylogenetic
	distance spanned by random versus inferred transfer events was similar,
	suggesting that real transfer events occur most frequently between
	closely related organisms, but can span large phylogenetic distances
	as well. While most of the protein trees examined here were very
	similar to the reference supertree, requiring zero or one edit operations
	for reconciliation, some trees implied up to 40 transfer events within
	a single orthologous set of proteins. CONCLUSION: Since sequence
	trees typically have no implied root and may contain unresolved or
	multifurcating nodes, the strategy implemented in EEEP is the most
	appropriate for phylogenomic analyses. The high degree of consistency
	among inferred protein trees shows that vertical inheritance is the
	dominant pattern of evolution, at least for the set of organisms
	considered here. However, the edit paths inferred using EEEP suggest
	an important role for genetic transfer in the evolution of microbial
	genomes as well.},

	to check the isomorphism, respectively, compatibility, of a set of

	to the relative location of a small subset of taxa. Then, we use
	these algorithms as subroutines to solve MAST and MCT on rooted or

  abstract = {Estimating phylogenetic relationships among closely related species
	can be extremely difficult when there is incongruence among gene
	trees and between the gene trees and the species tree. Here we show
	that incorporating a model of the stochastic loss of gene lineages
	by genetic drift into the phylogenetic estimation procedure can provide
	a robust estimate of species relationships, despite widespread incomplete
	sorting of ancestral polymorphism. This approach is applied to a
	group of montane Melanoplus grasshoppers for which genealogical discordance
	among loci and incomplete lineage sorting obscures any obvious phylogenetic
	relationships among species. Unlike traditional treatments where
	gene trees estimated using standard phylogenetic methods are implicitly
	equated with the species tree, with the coalescent-based approach
	the species tree is modeled probabilistically from the estimated
	gene trees. The estimated species phylogeny (the ESP) is calculated
	for the grasshoppers from multiple gene trees reconstructed for nuclear
	loci and a mitochondrial gene. This empirical application is coupled
	with a simulation study to explore the performance of the coalescent-based
	approach. Specifically, we test the accuracy of the ESP given the
	data based on analyses of simulated data matching the multilocus
	data collected in Melanoplus (i.e., data were simulated for each
	locus with the same number of base pairs and locus-specific mutational
	models). The results of the study show that ESPs can be computed
	using the coalescent-based approach long before reciprocal monophyly
	has been achieved, and that these statistical estimates are accurate.
	This contrasts with analyses of the empirical data collected in Melanoplus
	and simulated data based on concatenation of multiple loci, for which
	the incomplete lineage sorting of recently diverged species posed
	significant problems. The strengths and potential challenges associated
	with incorporating an explicit model of gene-lineage coalescence
	into the phylogenetic procedure to obtain an ESP, as illustrated
	by application to Melanoplus, versus concatenation and consensus
	approaches are discussed. This study represents a fundamental shift
	in how species relationships are estimated - the relationship between
	the gene trees and the species phylogeny is modeled probabilistically

	of taxa ranging from song birds to conifers. Such patterns are expected
	theoretically for species characterized by certain life history characteristics
	(e.g. long generation times) and those influenced by certain historical
	demographic events (e.g. recent divergences). A number of methods
	to estimate the underlying species phylogeny from a set of gene trees
	have been proposed and shown to be effective when incomplete lineage
	sorting has occurred. The further effects of gene flow on those methods,
	however, remain to be investigated. Here, we focus on the performance
	of three methods of species tree inference, ESP-COAL, minimizing
	deep coalescence (MDC), and concatenation, when incomplete lineage
	sorting and gene flow jointly confound the relationship between gene
	and species trees. Performance was investigated using Monte Carlo
	coalescent simulations under four models (n-island, stepping stone,
	parapatric, and allopatric) and three magnitudes of gene flow (N(e)m=0.01,
	0.10, 1.00). Although results varied by the model and magnitude of
	gene flow, methods incorporating aspects of the coalescent process
	(ESP-COAL and MDC) performed well, with probabilities of identifying
	the correct species tree topology typically increasing to greater
	than 0.75 when five more loci are sampled. The only exceptions to
	that pattern included gene flow at moderate to high magnitudes under
	the n-island and stepping stone models. Concatenation performs poorly
	relative to the other methods. We extend these results to a discussion

	trees that allow gene tree heterogeneity and whose tips represent
	lineages, populations and species, as opposed to genes-represent
	an exciting confluence of phylogenetics, phylogeography, and population
	genetics, and ushers in a new generation of concepts and challenges
	for the molecular systematist. In this essay I argue that to better
	deal with the large multilocus datasets brought on by phylogenomics,
	and to better align the fields of phylogeography and phylogenetics,
	we should embrace the primacy of species trees, not only as a new
	and useful practical tool for systematics, but also as a long-standing
	conceptual goal of systematics that, largely due to the lack of appropriate
	computational tools, has been eclipsed in the past few decades. I
	suggest that phylogenies as gene trees are a "local optimum" for
	systematics, and review recent advances that will bring us to the
	broader optimum inherent in species trees. In addition to adopting
	new methods of phylogenetic analysis (and ideally reserving the term
	"phylogeny" for species trees rather than gene trees), the new paradigm
	suggests shifts in a number of practices, such as sampling data to
	maximize not only the number of accumulated sites but also the number
	of independently segregating genes; routinely using coalescent or
	other models in computer simulations to allow gene tree heterogeneity;
	and understanding better the role of concatenation in influencing
	topologies and confidence in phylogenies. By building on the foundation
	laid by concepts of gene trees and coalescent theory, and by taking
	cues from recent trends in multilocus phylogeography, molecular systematics
	stands to be enriched. Many of the challenges and lessons learned
	for estimating gene trees will carry over to the challenge of estimating
	species trees, although adopting the species tree paradigm will clarify
	many issues (such as the nature of polytomies and the star tree paradox),
	raise conceptually new challenges, or provide new answers to old

  abstract = {Molecular methods as applied to the biogeography of single species
	(phylogeography) or multiple codistributed species (comparative phylogeography)
	have been productively and extensively used to elucidate common historical
	features in the diversification of the Earth's biota. However, only
	recently have methods for estimating population divergence times
	or their confidence limits while taking into account the critical
	effects of genetic polymorphism in ancestral species become available,
	and earlier methods for doing so are underutilized. We review models
	that address the crucial distinction between the gene divergence,
	the parameter that is typically recovered in molecular phylogeographic
	studies, and the population divergence, which is in most cases the
	parameter of interest and will almost always postdate the gene divergence.
	Assuming that population sizes of ancestral species are distributed
	similarly to those of extant species, we show that phylogeographic
	studies in vertebrates suggest that divergence of alleles in ancestral
	species can comprise from less than 10\% to over 50\% of the total
	divergence between sister species, suggesting that the problem of
	ancestral polymorphism in dating population divergence can be substantial.
	The variance in the number of substitutions (among loci for a given
	species or among species for a given gene) resulting from the stochastic
	nature of DNA change is generally smaller than the variance due to
	substitutions along allelic lines whose coalescence times vary due
	to genetic drift in the ancestral population. Whereas the former
	variance can be reduced by further DNA sequencing at a single locus,
	the latter cannot. Contrary to phylogeographic intuition, dating
	population divergence times when allelic lines have achieved reciprocal
	monophyly is in some ways more challenging than when allelic lines
	have not achieved monophyly, because in the former case critical
	data on ancestral population size provided by residual ancestral
	polymorphism is lost. In the former case differences in coalescence
	time between species pairs can in principle be explained entirely
	by differences in ancestral population size without resorting to
	explanations involving differences in divergence time. Furthermore,
	the confidence limits on population divergence times are severely
	underestimated when those for number of substitutions per site in
	the DNA sequences examined are used as a proxy. This uncertainty
	highlights the importance of multilocus data in estimating population
	divergence times; multilocus data can in principle distinguish differences
	in coalescence time (T) resulting from differences in population
	divergence time and differences in T due to differences in ancestral
	population sizes and will reduce the confidence limits on the estimates.
	We analyze the contribution of ancestral population size (theta)
	to T and the effect of uncertainty in theta on estimates of population
	divergence (tau) for single loci under reciprocal monophyly using
	a simple Bayesian extension of Takahata and Satta's and Yang's recent
	coalescent methods. The confidence limits on tau decrease when the
	range over which ancestral population size theta is assumed to be
	distributed decreases and when tau increases; they generally exclude
	zero when tau/(4Ne) > 1. We also apply a maximum-likelihood method
	to several single and multilocus data sets. With multilocus data,
	the criterion for excluding tau = 0 is roughly that l tau/(4Ne) >
	1, where l is the number of loci. Our analyses corroborate recent
	suggestions that increasing the number of loci is critical to decreasing
	the uncertainty in estimates of population divergence time.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Inferring species phylogenies with a history of gene losses
	and duplications is a challenging and an important task in computational
	biology. This problem can be solved by duplication-loss models in
	which the primary step is to reconcile a rooted gene tree with a
	rooted species tree. Most modern methods of phylogenetic reconstruction
	(from sequences) produce unrooted gene trees. This limitation leads
	to the problem of transforming unrooted gene tree into a rooted tree,
	and then reconciling rooted trees. The main questions are 'What about
	biological interpretation of choosing rooting?', 'Can we find efficiently
	the optimal rootings?', 'Is the optimal rooting unique?'. RESULTS:
	In this paper we present a model of reconciling unrooted gene tree
	with a rooted species tree, which is based on a concept of choosing
	rooting which has minimal reconciliation cost. Our analysis leads
	to the surprising property that all the minimal rootings have identical
	distributions of gene duplications and gene losses in the species
	tree. It implies, in our opinion, that the concept of an optimal
	rooting is very robust, and thus biologically meaningful. Also, it
	has nice computational properties. We present a linear time and space
	algorithm for computing optimal rooting(s). This algorithm was used
	in two different ways to reconstruct the optimal species phylogeny
	of five known yeast genomes from approximately 4700 gene trees. Moreover,
	we determined locations (history) of all gene duplications and gene
	losses in the final species tree. It is interesting to notice that
	the top five species trees are the same for both methods. AVAILABILITY:

	and historical demography, fields which have been dominated by microsatellite
	markers and mitochondrial DNA, particularly for vertebrates. Using
	30 newly developed anonymous nuclear loci, we estimated population
	divergence times and ancestral population sizes of three closely
	related species of Australian grass finches (Poephila) distributed
	across two barriers in northern Australia. We verified that substitution
	rates were generally constant both among lineages and among loci,
	and that intralocus recombination was uncommon in our dataset, thereby
	satisfying two assumptions of our multilocus analysis. The reconstructed
	gene trees exhibited all three possible tree topologies and displayed
	considerable variation in coalescent times, yet this information
	provided the raw data for maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation
	of population divergence times and ancestral population sizes. Estimates
	of these parameters were in close agreement with each other regardless
	of statistical approach and our Bayesian estimates were robust to
	prior assumptions. Our results suggest that black-throated finches
	(Poephila cincta) diverged from long-tailed finches (P. acuticauda
	and P. hecki) across the Carpentarian Barrier in northeastern Australia
	around 0.6 million years ago (mya), and that P. acuticauda diverged
	from P. hecki across the Kimberley Plateau-Arnhem Land Barrier in
	northwestern Australia approximately 0.3 mya. Bayesian 95\% credibility
	intervals around these estimates strongly support Pleistocene timing
	for both speciation events, despite the fact that many gene divergences
	across the Carpentarian region clearly predated the Pleistocene.
	Estimates of ancestral effective population sizes for the basal ancestor
	and long-tailed finch ancestor were large (about 521,000 and about
	384,000, respectively). Although the errors around the population
	size parameter estimates are considerable, they are the first for

  abstract = {Genetic data are frequently used to delimit species, where species
	status is determined on the basis of an exclusivity criterium, such
	as reciprocal monophyly. Not only are there numerous empirical examples
	of incongruence between the boundaries inferred from such data compared
	to other sources like morphology -- especially with recently derived
	species, but population genetic theory also clearly shows that an
	inevitable bias in species status results because genetic thresholds
	do not explicitly take into account how the timing of speciation
	influences patterns of genetic differentiation. This study represents
	a fundamental shift in how genetic data might be used to delimit
	species. Rather than equating gene trees with a species tree or basing
	species status on some genetic threshold, the relationship between
	the gene trees and the species history is modeled probabilistically.
	Here we show that the same theory that is used to calculate the probability
	of reciprocal monophyly can also be used to delimit species despite
	widespread incomplete lineage sorting. The results from a preliminary
	simulation study suggest that very recently derived species can be
	accurately identified long before the requisite time for reciprocal
	monophyly to be achieved following speciation. The study also indicates
	the importance of sampling, both with regards to loci and individuals.
	Withstanding a thorough investigation into the conditions under which
	the coalescent-based approach will be effective, namely how the timing
	of divergence relative to the effective population size of species
	affects accurate species delimitation, the results are nevertheless
	consistent with other recent studies (aimed at inferring species
	relationships), showing that despite the lack of monophyletic gene
	trees, a signal of species divergence persists and can be extracted.
	Using an explicit model-based approach also avoids two primary problems
	with species delimitation that result when genetic thresholds are
	applied with genetic data -- the inherent biases in species detection
	arising from when and how speciation occurred, and failure to take
	into account the high stochastic variance of genetic processes. Both
	the utility and sensitivities of the coalescent-based approach outlined
	here are discussed; most notably, a model-based approach is essential
	for determining whether incompletely sorted gene lineages are (or
	are not) consistent with separate species lineages, and such inferences
	require accurate model parameterization (i.e., a range of realistic
	effective population sizes relative to potential times of divergence
	for the purported species). It is the goal (and motivation of this
	study) that genetic data might be used effectively as a source of
	complementation to other sources of data for diagnosing species,
	as opposed to the exclusion of other evidence for species delimitation,
	which will require an explicit consideration of the effects of the
	temporal dynamic of lineage splitting on genetic data.},

	for estimating species trees explicitly take into account the cause

  abstract = {The desire to infer the evolutionary history of a group of species
	should be more viable now that a considerable amount of multilocus
	molecular data is available. However, the current molecular phylogenetic
	paradigm still reconstructs gene trees to represent the species tree.
	Further, commonly used methods of combining data, such as the concatenation
	method, are known to be inconsistent in some circumstances. In this
	paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate the phylogeny
	of a group of species using multiple estimated gene tree distributions,
	such as those that arise in a Bayesian analysis of DNA sequence data.
	Our model employs substitution models used in traditional phylogenetics
	but also uses coalescent theory to explain genealogical signals from
	species trees to gene trees and from gene trees to sequence data,
	thereby forming a complete stochastic model to estimate gene trees,
	species trees, ancestral population sizes, and species divergence
	times simultaneously. Our model is founded on the assumption that
	gene trees, even of unlinked loci, are correlated due to being derived
	from a single species tree and therefore should be estimated jointly.
	We apply the method to two multilocus data sets of DNA sequences.
	The estimates of the species tree topology and divergence times appear
	to be robust to the prior of the population size, whereas the estimates
	of effective population sizes are sensitive to the prior used in
	the analysis. These analyses also suggest that the model is superior
	to the concatenation method in fitting these data sets and thus provides
	a more realistic assessment of the variability in the distribution
	of the species tree that may have produced the molecular information
	at hand. Future improvements of our model and algorithm should include
	consideration of other factors that can cause discordance of gene
	trees and species trees, such as horizontal transfer or gene duplication.},

	factors that can cause gene tree heterogeneity and discordance with
	the species tree, deep coalescence due to random genetic drift in
	branches of the species tree has been modeled most thoroughly. Bayesian
	approaches to estimating species trees utilizes two likelihood functions,
	one of which has been widely used in traditional phylogenetics and
	involves the model of nucleotide substitution, and the second of
	which is less familiar to phylogeneticists and involves the probability
	distribution of gene trees given a species tree. Other recent parametric
	and nonparametric methods for estimating species trees involve parsimony
	criteria, summary statistics, supertree and consensus methods. Species
	tree approaches are an appropriate goal for systematics, appear to
	work well in some cases where concatenation can be misleading, and
	suggest that sampling many independent loci will be paramount. Such
	methods can also be challenging to implement because of the complexity
	of the models and computational time. In addition, further elaboration
	of the simplest of coalescent models will be required to incorporate
	commonly known issues such as deviation from the molecular clock,
	gene flow and other genetic forces.},

  title = {Bayesian coestimation of phylogeny and sequence alignment.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Two central problems in computational biology are the
	determination of the alignment and phylogeny of a set of biological
	sequences. The traditional approach to this problem is to first build
	a multiple alignment of these sequences, followed by a phylogenetic
	reconstruction step based on this multiple alignment. However, alignment
	and phylogenetic inference are fundamentally interdependent, and
	ignoring this fact leads to biased and overconfident estimations.
	Whether the main interest be in sequence alignment or phylogeny,
	a major goal of computational biology is the co-estimation of both.
	RESULTS: We developed a fully Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method
	for coestimating phylogeny and sequence alignment, under the Thorne-Kishino-Felsenstein
	model of substitution and single nucleotide insertion-deletion (indel)
	events. In our earlier work, we introduced a novel and efficient
	algorithm, termed the "indel peeling algorithm", which includes indels
	as phylogenetically informative evolutionary events, and resembles
	Felsenstein's peeling algorithm for substitutions on a phylogenetic
	tree. For a fixed alignment, our extension analytically integrates
	out both substitution and indel events within a proper statistical
	model, without the need for data augmentation at internal tree nodes,
	allowing for efficient sampling of tree topologies and edge lengths.
	To additionally sample multiple alignments, we here introduce an
	efficient partial Metropolized independence sampler for alignments,
	and combine these two algorithms into a fully Bayesian co-estimation
	procedure for the alignment and phylogeny problem. Our approach results
	in estimates for the posterior distribution of evolutionary rate
	parameters, for the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) phylogenetic tree,
	and for the posterior decoding alignment. Estimates for the evolutionary
	tree and multiple alignment are augmented with confidence estimates
	for each node height and alignment column. Our results indicate that
	the patterns in reliability broadly correspond to structural features
	of the proteins, and thus provides biologically meaningful information
	which is not existent in the usual point-estimate of the alignment.
	Our methods can handle input data of moderate size (10-20 protein
	sequences, each 100-200 bp), which we analyzed overnight on a standard
	2 GHz personal computer. CONCLUSION: Joint analysis of multiple sequence
	alignment, evolutionary trees and additional evolutionary parameters
	can be now done within a single coherent statistical framework.},

  abstract = {It is now well known that incomplete lineage sorting can cause serious
	difficulties for phylogenetic inference, but little attention has
	been paid to methods that attempt to overcome these difficulties
	by explicitly considering the processes that produce them. Here we
	explore approaches to phylogenetic inference designed to consider
	retention and sorting of ancestral polymorphism. We examine how the
	reconstructability of a species (or population) phylogeny is affected
	by (a) the number of loci used to estimate the phylogeny and (b)
	the number of individuals sampled per species. Even in difficult
	cases with considerable incomplete lineage sorting (times between
	divergences less than 1 N(e) generations), we found the reconstructed
	species trees matched the "true" species trees in at least three
	out of five partitions, as long as a reasonable number of individuals
	per species were sampled. We also studied the tradeoff between sampling
	more loci versus more individuals. Although increasing the number
	of loci gives more accurate trees for a given sampling effort with
	deeper species trees (e.g., total depth of 10 N(e) generations),
	sampling more individuals often gives better results than sampling
	more loci with shallower species trees (e.g., depth = 1 N(e)). Taken
	together, these results demonstrate that gene sequences retain enough
	signal to achieve an accurate estimate of phylogeny despite widespread
	incomplete lineage sorting. Continued improvement in our methods
	to reconstruct phylogeny near the species level will require a shift
	to a compound model that considers not only nucleotide or character
	state substitutions, but also the population genetics processes of
	lineage sorting. [Coalescence; divergence; population; speciation.].},

	insertions and deletions, and gene trees. The time inferred to span
	the two key speciation events is short enough that under the coalescent
	model, the incongruence could be the result of incomplete lineage

	elapid snakes, we separately found the shortest trees from the amino
	acid sequences for the venom proteins phospholipase A2 and the short
	neurotoxin, collectively representing 32 species in 16 genera. We
	then applied a method we term gene tree parsimony for inferring species
	trees from gene trees that works by finding the species tree which
	minimizes the number of deep coalescences or gene duplications plus
	unsampled sequences necessary to fit each gene tree to the species
	tree. This procedure, which is both logical and generally applicable,
	avoids many of the problems of previous approaches for inferring
	species trees from gene trees. The results support a division of
	the elapids examined into sister groups of the Australian and marine
	(laticaudines and hydrophiines) species, and the African and Asian
	species. Within the former clade, the sea snakes are shown to be
	diphyletic, with the laticaudines and hydrophiines having separate
	origins. This finding is corroborated by previous studies, which
	provide support for the usefulness of gene tree parsimony.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Inferring the evolutionary history of a set of species,
	known as the species tree, is a task of utmost significance in biology
	and beyond. The traditional approach to accomplishing this task from
	molecular sequences entails sequencing a gene in the set of species
	under consideration, reconstructing the gene's evolutionary history,
	and declaring it to be the species tree. However, recent analyses
	of multiple gene data sets, made available thanks to advances in
	sequencing technologies, have indicated that gene trees in the same
	group of species may disagree with each other, as well as with the
	species tree. Therefore, the development of methods for inferring
	the species tree despite such disagreements is imperative. In this
	paper, we propose such a method, which seeks the tree that minimizes
	the amount of disagreement between the input set of gene trees and
	the inferred one. We have implemented our method and studied its
	performance, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, on
	two biological data sets and a large number of simulated data sets.
	Our analyses, of both the biological and synthetic data sets, indicate
	high accuracy of the method, as well as computationally efficient
	solutions in practice. Hence, our method makes a good candidate for
	inferring accurate species trees, despite gene tree disagreements,
	at a genomic scale.},

  abstract = {In a 1997 seminal paper, W. Maddison proposed minimizing deep coalescences,
	or MDC, as an optimization criterion for inferring the species tree
	from a set of incongruent gene trees, assuming the incongruence is
	exclusively due to lineage sorting. In a subsequent paper, Maddison
	and Knowles provided and implemented a search heuristic for optimizing
	the MDC criterion, given a set of gene trees. However, the heuristic
	is not guaranteed to compute optimal solutions, and its hill-climbing
	search makes it slow in practice. In this paper, we provide two exact
	solutions to the problem of inferring the species tree from a set
	of gene trees under the MDC criterion. In other words, our solutions
	are guaranteed to find the tree that minimizes the total number of
	deep coalescences from a set of gene trees. One solution is based
	on a novel integer linear programming (ILP) formulation, and another
	is based on a simple dynamic programming (DP) approach. Powerful
	ILP solvers, such as CPLEX, make the first solution appealing, particularly
	for very large-scale instances of the problem, whereas the DP-based
	solution eliminates dependence on proprietary tools, and its simplicity
	makes it easy to integrate with other genomic events that may cause
	gene tree incongruence. Using the exact solutions, we analyze a data
	set of 106 loci from eight yeast species, a data set of 268 loci
	from eight Apicomplexan species, and several simulated data sets.
	We show that the MDC criterion provides very accurate estimates of
	the species tree topologies, and that our solutions are very fast,
	thus allowing for the accurate analysis of genome-scale data sets.
	Further, the efficiency of the solutions allow for quick exploration
	of sub-optimal solutions, which is important for a parsimony-based
	criterion such as MDC, as we show. We show that searching for the
	species tree in the compatibility graph of the clusters induced by
	the gene trees may be sufficient in practice, a finding that helps
	ameliorate the computational requirements of optimization solutions.
	Further, we study the statistical consistency and convergence rate
	of the MDC criterion, as well as its optimality in inferring the
	species tree. Finally, we show how our solutions can be used to identify
	potential horizontal gene transfer events that may have caused some
	of the incongruence in the data, thus augmenting Maddison's original
	framework. We have implemented our solutions in the PhyloNet software
	package, which is freely available at: http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu/phylonet.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary trees sit at the core of all realistic models describing
	a set of related sequences, including alignment, homology search,
	ancestral protein reconstruction and 2D/3D structural change. It
	is important to assess the stochastic error when estimating a tree,
	including models using the most realistic likelihood-based optimizations,
	yet computation times may be many days or weeks. If so, the bootstrap
	is computationally prohibitive. Here we show that the extremely fast
	"resampling of estimated log likelihoods" or RELL method behaves
	well under more general circumstances than previously examined. RELL
	approximates the bootstrap (BP) proportions of trees better that
	some bootstrap methods that rely on fast heuristics to search the
	tree space. The BIC approximation of the Bayesian posterior probability
	(BPP) of trees is made more accurate by including an additional term
	related to the determinant of the information matrix (which may also
	be obtained as a product of gradient or score vectors). Such estimates
	are shown to be very close to MCMC chain values. Our analysis of
	mammalian mitochondrial amino acid sequences suggest that when model
	breakdown occurs, as it typically does for sequences separated by
	more than a few million years, the BPP values are far too peaked
	and the real fluctuations in the likelihood of the data are many
	times larger than expected. Accordingly, several ways to incorporate
	the bootstrap and other types of direct resampling with MCMC procedures
	are outlined. Genes evolve by a process which involves some sites
	following a tree close to, but not identical with, the species tree.
	It is seen that under such a likelihood model BP (bootstrap proportions)
	and BPP estimates may still be reasonable estimates of the species
	tree. Since many of the methods studied are very fast computationally,
	there is no reason to ignore stochastic error even with the slowest
	ML or likelihood based methods.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian method of phylogenetic inference often produces high
	posterior probabilities (PPs) for trees or clades, even when the
	trees are clearly incorrect. The problem appears to be mainly due
	to large sizes of molecular datasets and to the large-sample properties
	of Bayesian model selection and its sensitivity to the prior when
	several of the models under comparison are nearly equally correct
	(or nearly equally wrong) and are of the same dimension. A previous
	suggestion to alleviate the problem is to let the internal branch
	lengths in the tree become increasingly small in the prior with the
	increase in the data size so that the bifurcating trees are increasingly
	star-like. In particular, if the internal branch lengths are assigned
	the exponential prior, the prior mean mu0 should approach zero faster
	than 1/square root n but more slowly than 1/n, where n is the sequence
	length. This paper examines the usefulness of this data size-dependent
	prior using a dataset of the mitochondrial protein-coding genes from
	the baleen whales, with the prior mean fixed at mu0=0.1n(-2/3). In
	this dataset, phylogeny reconstruction is sensitive to the assumed
	evolutionary model, species sampling and the type of data (DNA or
	protein sequences), but Bayesian inference using the default prior
	attaches high PPs for conflicting phylogenetic relationships. The
	data size-dependent prior alleviates the problem to some extent,
	giving weaker support for unstable relationships. This prior may
	be useful in reducing apparent conflicts in the results of Bayesian
	analysis or in making the method less sensitive to model violations.},
