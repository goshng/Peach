Problem Set 1.2
---------------
3. (Recommended) Describe the intersection of the three planes u + v + w +
z = 6 and u+w+z = 4 and u+w = 2 (all in four-dimensional space). Is it a line or
a point or an empty set? What is the intersection if the fourth plane u = −1 is
included? Find a fourth equation that leaves us with no solution.

u + w = 2, v = 2, z = 2. It is a line. If u = -1, w = 3. 
One of them is u + w = 4.

4. Sketch these three lines and decide if the equations are solvable:
3 by 2 system
x + 2y = 2
x − y = 2
y = 1
What happens if all right-hand sides are zero? Is there any nonzero choice of
right-hand sides that allows the three lines to intersect at the same point?
