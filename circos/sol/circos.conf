# Links are defined in <link> blocks enclosed in a <links> block. The
# links start at a radial position defined by 'radius' and have their
# control point (adjusts curvature) at the radial position defined by
# 'bezier_radius'. In this example, I use the segmental duplication
# data set, which connects regions of similar sequence (90%+
# similarity, at least 1kb in size).
