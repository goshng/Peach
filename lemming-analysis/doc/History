~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MODELTEST is applied to each of the mtDNA genes. 

.Installation of JMODELTEST
. Requires phyml
. See http://www.molecularevolution.org/resources/activities/jmodeltest_activity

.Create FASTA sequence files from the mtDNA alignment
. See +mainExtractPartOfPhylip+ in +sh/main.sh+ 

.Use jModelTest
. See +mainJModelTest+ in +sh/main.sh+
. Could use the following options
---
java -jar jModelTest.jar --help
java -jar jModelTest.jar -d ATP6.fas -o ATP6.out -s 11 -p -AICc

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The multiple mtDNA alignment is partitioned into multiple regions. A MEGA
formatted file is converted to a PHYLIP-format one. A PERL script is created to
convert a PHYLIP-format file to another file with smaller part of the alignment.

.Download the MEGA file of the mtDNA genome alignment
---
$LOCAL/data/raw/Mega_mtGenome_23112011_Fin.meg
---

.Download the annotation file
---
$LOCAL/data/raw/mtDNA genome.xls
---

.Export the alignment to a phylip alignment in interleaved format
---
$LOCAL/data/Mega_mtGenome_23112011_Fin.phylip
---
When exporting a MEGA file to a PHYLIP file, make sure that you uncheck the menu
item "Display/Use Identical Symbol" so that all characters can be displayed
rather masked by dots.

.Export the annotation file to a CSV file
---
$LOCAL/data/mtDNA genome.csv
---

.Use an column extracter to extract parts of the PHYLIP alignment
---
pl/phyilp-part.pl
