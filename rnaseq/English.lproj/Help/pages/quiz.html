				a word in the list; simply enter your answer in the other text field and press <b>Return</b>. The answer
				you give will be compared with the correct value on a case-insensitive basis. If the answer you gave
				is identical (sorry, no fuzzy logic here!) you will be rewarded by having the score for that item increased
				in the original table; the correct answer will briefly be displayed in green as shown in the figure.
				If your guess was incorrect, the correct answer will be displayed in red. Bad student! No beer for you!

				<p>Scores for vocabulary on which you have tested yourself are maintained cumulatively and are color coded by
				percentage correct in the table display. Purple: > 80 % correct; Green: 60 to 80 %, Yellow: 40 to 60 %, Red: 20 to 40 %,

				You can reset the scores for all or selected entries by choosing </b>Reset Scores</b> from the <b>Lexicon</b> menu.
				A numerical score summary is reported by text in the inspector panel for any selected item.</span></td>
