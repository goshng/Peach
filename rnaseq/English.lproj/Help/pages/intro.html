		<p><span class="bold">VocableTrainerX</span> is an application that allows you to manage vocabulary lists for studying a second language
		and test yourself on vocabulary sets using a flash-card model. You could also use VocableTrainerX to maintain glossaries of technical terms and their definitions.
		A vocabulary list (herein also referred to as a <i>lexicon</i>) is displayed in a table view within a single VocableTrainerX document.<p>
		Each entry in the table consists of a word or phrase rendered in two different languages, supported by additional data.
		The supporting data includes a user-specified category for the table entry, such as  the part of speech or a functional topic for the vocabulary item, e.g., "Nouns" or "In the office",
		or perhaps a chapter or lesson number from your language course, as well as cumulative test scores for each item in a vocabulary list.
		By selecting certain items in the table before ordering a test, you will be tested only on those items, or all items, if none are selected beforehand.<p>
		<p>Each lexicon entry is fully-editable (except for test scores), and you can add to and delete from the list using application controls, such as toolbar buttons and menu items.
		Addition, deletion, and editing of vocabulary items is undoable in most cases, and a lexicon (whole or in part) can be copied-and-pasted into other VocableTrainerX documents or applications such as Excel or text editors.
		You can also import data prepared in some of these other programs, in comma-separated-value (CSV) format, and export text files in the same format. A drawer that extends from the document window
		displays a table with a list of all the categories represented in the document, and you can filter the table selection into category-based subsets by selecting items in the category list.
		The application is also able to print a lexicon table in a simple format using the OS X printing subsystem, so you can study your lists when you are away from your computer.
