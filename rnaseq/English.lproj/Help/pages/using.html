				the Cocoa document architecture provides a list of recently-opened documents as well.
				The <b>File</b> menu also contains the commands for importing data in CSV-format from text files prepared in other programs.
				<p>The document window has a toolbar for commonly-used VocableTrainerX controls. Its search field allows you to filter the table for a
				set of items containing a particular text string in either of the language fields. The search field does <b>not</b> filter based
				on the <b>Topic</b> field (but see below, for a discussion of the Topics table in the
				<A HREF="../pages/drawer.html">drawer </A>associated with each window.)
				<p>You will also notice that when the search field is active, the <b>Save</b> menu item is disabled to prevent overwriting
				the document's full set of vocabulary with the search set; you can use <b>Save as...</b> to overwrite the file, but you
				must then confirm that you really want to overwrite an existing file, as usual.</span></td>

				(these strings are also used to label the data entry fields that appear in the inspector window used for data entry and review and
				are also used in the quiz window). <p>The document settings sheet can be opened by selecting <B>Settings...</b>
				from the <b>Window</b> menu, illustrated in the figure just below. You can set whether a new document opens automatically
				when VocableTrainerX is launched or re-activated in VocableTrainerX's <A HREF="../pages/preferences.html"><b>Preferences</b></A> window;
				An inspector window (also shown below) allows you to enter or inspect individual table entries.
				The inspector is a utility window that floats above the main document window, and is opened a command in the <b>Window</b> menu.
				Close it by typing <b>ESC</b> while it is the key window.

				<td><span class="plain">To add a new entry to the table, press the <b>Insert Item</b> button. The new item will be added with
				placeholder values that you can edit either by typing in the data entry (inspector) fields or by editing the table cells
				directly. <p>Tabbing between cells in the table or in the inspector window is enabled using each window's standard key-view loop.
				Pressing <b>Return</b> while editing any inspector field commits the data and simultaneously adds a new placeholder item to the table.
				This is handy if you need to enter a group of new vocabulary items in quick succession. Simply edit the new item (which
				will be selected) in the inspector window and press <b>Return</b> when finished to start a new item.
				<p>When a single entry or group of entries is selected in the table, the <b>Delete Item</b> button will be enabled. Both addition
				and deletion of entries is usually undoable, and is also supported by <B>Insert</b> and <b>Delete</b>
				menu items with keyboard shortcuts, which appear in VocableTrainerX's <b>Lexicon</b> menu.

				<p>The <b>Swap Languages</b> item is handy if you have made the common data-entry error of swapping values in the
				language columns. <p>The <b>Reset Scores</b> item will zero the <A HREF="../pages/quiz.html">quiz</A> scores (see below) of selected items,
				or of all of them (if none are selected). Once you have saved a file, previous changes will not be undoable.
				<p>Note that when multiple entries are selected, some inspector fields may indicate "Multiple Values".
