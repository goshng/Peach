				works in tandem with the filtering action of the search field in the toolbar.<p>
				While search-field filtering is in progress, several program features are disabled, including adding entries to and
				deleting entries from the main vocabulary table; cutting and pasting are also prohibited.
				Importing CSV data from a text file is also not allowed during filtering.
				However items can be <i>copied</i> from a filtered list and then pasted into
				another document or exported as CSV, as long as the target document is not also being filtered.
				You are also permitted to conduct a quiz on a filtered list, to save the filtered data to the same or a different
				disk file, using the "Save As..." command.<p></span></td>

		<p>Clicking the header cell of the topics list to sort the list also deselects any selected items and cancels filtering by topic.
