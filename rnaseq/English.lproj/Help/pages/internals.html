		<p>VocableTrainerX is not only open source, but it actually discloses the sequence of steps employed in developing the code. This description
		is somewhat terse, so you should have an intermediate knowledge of the Cocoa API and Objective-C before reading and following these steps.
		No warranty, express or implied, is offered as to whether the enclosed instructions are complete or 100% correct. Nor does the author
		warrant that all, or even <i>any</i>, of the interface or implementation design decisions were very good ones.
