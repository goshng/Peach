		There is a certain amount of theory concerning the most effective ways to memorize pair sets such as vocabulary.<p>
		Dissertations could be (and probably have been) written about it. Doing this on the cheap means managing your own learning curve.<p>
		Common sense recommends that you probably should not practice your high-percentage items as often as the less-well recognized ones.<p>
		The theory comes in because you <b>also</b> should not entirely stop practicing the ones you know well. The devil, as they say, is in the details.<p>
		If I loaded this program up with features to take advantage of that theory, I would probably have to charge you for them.
		This application is not about theory, but about "Practice, Practice, Practice!" Best we leave well-enough alone!<p>
		<p>This application also comes with a fairly thorough description of the steps that were involved in building it. Click on the link below...<p>
