<I>For not having had to reinvent a full set of wheels for VocableTrainerX, the author of this version
(DJS) extends special thanks to:</I>
<UL>
<LI>Vermont Recipes, by Bill Cheeseman and <A HREF="http://www.stepwise.com">Stepwise</A>,
with additional profuse thanks to the good folks at <A HREF="http://www.cocoadev.com">CocoaDev</A>.</LI><BR>
<LI>For assistance in enabling bindings in this version, special gratitude is due to mmalcolm crawford, whose 
<A HREF="http://homepage.mac.com/mmalc/CocoaExamples/controllers.html">examples</A>
(especially Manual Bindings) were invaluable in finally implementing Undo Manager support
combined with the use of Bindings. Additionally, this design follows closely the
example in the second edition of <i>Cocoa Programming for OS X</i> by Aaron Hillegass (Addison-Wesley, 2004).</LI><BR>
<LI>The main table's array controller is an almost-unmodified version of crawford's Filtering Controller example.
The images used in the <b>Scores</b> column of the table were extracted from an icon collection
distributed by <A HREF="http://www.wbchug.com">Yazoo</A>. God bless Yaz, as they say in Boston.</LI><BR>
<LI>Redoubled thanks also go to <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</A> for hosting this project.
