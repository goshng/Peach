Columns: ,chr,cis.pen,cis.notpen,trans.pen,trans.notpen,notunique,total
eQTLs (genes with differential expression) from different ILs in the same
chromosome can be cis and trans because the IL regions are different among those
ILs in the same chromosome. Similarly, eQTLs expression patterns from ILs in the
same chromosome can be different from PEN's exression patterns. These are
counted in the column notunique. So,
cis.pen + cis.notpen + trans.pen + trans.notpen = notunique + total
for each chromosome.

number-gene-il-snp.txt - the total number of unique genes in IL_SNP_gene.

ven-snp.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~
Unique IL SNPs and PEN SNPs, the intersection set of them are counted.
This is created by R/ven-snp.R.
