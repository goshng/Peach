Format of Biological Sequences
==============================
Sang Chul Choi <goshng@yahoo.co.kr>

I wish to list data formats that are used in biological sciences. Some formats
are used only in a particular software package. This directory contains sample
data files. We would collate a C library of handling files in different data
formats. This would allow users to easily incoporate the source code to deal
with different sequence data.
