Create a script that run on the cluster.

We need four shell scripts.
createjobidfile.sh: this should be modified to create a jobidfile.
run.sh: this may need to be changed. This would prepare some input and output
directories.
batch.sh: this script is the main batch shell script that would be run by batch
system.
batchjob.sh: this script needs to be modified for the specific executable or
PhyML.
