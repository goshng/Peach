  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genetic studies focus on increasingly larger genomic regions
	of both extant and ancient DNA, and there is a need for simulation
	software to match these technological advances. We present here a
	new coalescent-based simulation program fastsimcoal, which is able
	to quickly simulate a variety of genetic markers scattered over very
	long genomic regions with arbitrary recombination patterns under
	complex evolutionary scenarios. Availability and Implementation:
	fastsimcoal is a C++ program compiled for Windows, MacOsX and Linux
	platforms. It is freely available at cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoal/,
	together with its detailed user manual and example input files. CONTACT:
	laurent.excoffier@iee.unibe.ch SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary
	data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {In 1988, Felsenstein described a framework for assessing the likelihood
	of a genetic data set in which all of the possible genealogical histories
	of the data are considered, each in proportion to their probability.
	Although not analytically solvable, several approaches, including
	Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, have been developed to find approximate
	solutions. Here, we describe an approach in which Markov chain Monte
	Carlo simulations are used to integrate over the space of genealogies,
	whereas other parameters are integrated out analytically. The result
	is an approximation to the full joint posterior density of the model
	parameters. For many purposes, this function can be treated as a
	likelihood, thereby permitting likelihood-based analyses, including
	likelihood ratio tests of nested models. Several examples, including
	an application to the divergence of chimpanzee subspecies, are provided.},

  abstract = {A Markov chain Monte Carlo method for estimating the relative effects
	of migration and isolation on genetic diversity in a pair of populations
	from DNA sequence data is developed and tested using simulations.
	The two populations are assumed to be descended from a panmictic
	ancestral population at some time in the past and may (or may not)
	after that be connected by migration. The use of a Markov chain Monte
	Carlo method allows the joint estimation of multiple demographic
	parameters in either a Bayesian or a likelihood framework. The parameters
	estimated include the migration rate for each population, the time
	since the two populations diverged from a common ancestral population,
	and the relative size of each of the two current populations and
	of the common ancestral population. The results show that even a
	single nonrecombining genetic locus can provide substantial power
	to test the hypothesis of no ongoing migration and/or to test models
	of symmetric migration between the two populations. The use of the
	method is illustrated in an application to mitochondrial DNA sequence
	data from a fish species: the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus
	aculeatus).},
