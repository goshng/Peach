A general purpose Objective-C Class library
http://code.google.com/p/ofc/

IOLib is a portable universal data IO library. Implementations exist in C, C++
and Objective C and for many different platforms (including Linux, Win32, MacOS
X and .NET).
IOLib provides a unified interface for accessing different types of data
streams. It currently supports file IO, BSD sockets, memory buffers and SOCKS4/5
connections and can be extended with 'drivers' easily.
It has support for different binary formats (Intel, Motorola, PDP) and it
supports filters. You can write your own filters (e.g. for encryption or
compression) and use them with IOLib.
