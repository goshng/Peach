The main data set
-----------------
The data set of 408 loci is in +summarize-sequence-data.txt+.
Another data file +summarize-sequence-data-for-assignment.txt+ is a version for
population assignment.
A prior file for the three populations +prior-file1+ can be used with 
+summarize-sequence-data.txt+. Two more prior files +prior-file2+
+prior-file3+ are created by modifying the first one.

File +summarize-sequence-data1+ is the same as 
+summarize-sequence-data.txt+. 
Files +summarize-sequence-data2+ and 
+summarize-sequence-data3+ are data files for two alternative trees.
