Menu *ima2-prepare* is added to run the data +data/summarize-sequence-data.txt+
with three different trees. Menu *ima2-receive* needs to be added to get the
result from the cluster. The two splitting event times in the tree where
rifipogon is the out-group appear to be nearer than what it was reported in
Molina et al. (2011). Using BEAST they reported that the larger splitting event
time was twice as much as the smaller one. Using 408 loci data set in the file
+data/summarize-sequence-data.txt+ the two splitting event times appear to be 
similar. The following is the result of the +output/osativa/1+

The population size of rufipogon appeared to be much larger than those of the
other two of indica and japonica. I need to increase the the prior of
rufipogon's population size. I increase the maximum of population size to three
times as the other's.

Abstract
--------
Recently, rice genomes were sequenced in multiple individuals spanning three
species. The phylogenetic relationship of these could have been resolved using
the data set. The method developed in BEAST was not able to handle the data set
presumably because the sequence data were not informative enough. Instead, the
authors (Molina 2011) used site-frequency spectrum to sidestep the problem. They
took advantage of other data sets not the data set they obtained. Here, we
consider that 

Methods and Materials

We downloaded the rice DNA sequences at

Introduction
------------
.Parts that I need to consider.
. Three rice species: O. rufipogon, O. sativa ssp. indica, and O. sativa ssp.
tropical japonica (rufipogon, indica, japonica).
. Inferring species tree.
.. *BEAST
